It  provides a boost to petitioners for LGBT rights. It says you cannot compel people to incriminate themselves when accused of an offence, something common in India. </p><p>\"The sheer sweep means the judgement will become a reference point in a lot of areas of law,\" leading lawyer Rebecca John told me. \"I think it will have far reaching implications on Indian life.\"</p><div aria-hidden=\"true\" class=\"bbccom_slot mpu-ad\" id=\"bbccom_mpu_1_2_3\">\n<div class=\"bbccom_advert\">\n<script type=\"text/javascript\">\n            /**/\n            (function() {\n                if (window.bbcdotcom && bbcdotcom.adverts && bbcdotcom.adverts.slotAsync) {\n                    bbcdotcom.adverts.slotAsync('mpu', [1,2,3]);\n                }\n            })();\n            /**/\n        </script>\n</div>\n</div><ul class=\"story-body__unordered-list\">\n<li class=\"story-body__list-item\"><a class=\"story-body__link\" href=\"/news/world-asia-india-39769322\">Aadhaar: Are a billion identities at risk?</a></li>\n<li class=\"story-body__list-item\"><a class=\"story-body__link\" href=\"/news/world-asia-40371523\">How did India get biometric data of 1bn people?</a></li>\n<li class=\"story-body__list-item\"><a class=\"story-body__link\" href=\"/news/18231639\">Will India's identity number really be a game changer?</a></li>\n<li class=\"story-body__list-item\"><a class=\"story-body__link\" href=\"/news/world-asia-india-18156858\">Why India's identity scheme is groundbreaking</a></li>\n</ul><p>At a time when many Indians worry that some of their essential private freedoms are under threat - the <a class=\"story-body__link\" href=\"http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-asia-india-40116811\">right to eat </a>what you want, and the <a class=\"story-body__link\" href=\"http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-asia-india-38494433\">way you want to dress</a>, for example -  the judges offer some stirring passages in what is a largely a cogent and well-researched 547-page<a class=\"story-body__link-external\" href=\"https://barandbench.com/right-privacy-fundamental-right-supreme-court/\"> verdict</a>:</p><ul class=\"story-body__unordered-list\"><li class=\"story-body__list-item\">Privacy includes at its core the preservation of personal intimacies, the sanctity of family life, marriage, procreation, the home and sexual orientation. Privacy also connotes a right to be left alone. Privacy safeguards individual autonomy and recognises the ability of the individual to control vital aspects of his or her life. Personal choices governing a way of life are intrinsic to privacy. Privacy protects heterogeneity and recognises the plurality and diversity of our culture. </li></ul><ul class=\"story-body__unordered-list\">\n<li class=\"story-body__list-item\">Liberty and freedom are values which are intrinsic to our constitutional order. But they also have an instrumental value in creating conditions in which socio-economic rights can be achieved. India has no iron curtain. Our society prospers in the shadow of its drapes which let in sunshine and reflect a multitude of hues based on language, religion, culture and ideologies.</li>\n<li class=\"story-body__list-item\">Liberty enables the individual to have a choice of preferences on various facets of life including what and how one will eat, the way one will dress, the faith one will espouse and a myriad other matters on which autonomy and self-determination require a choice to be made within the privacy of the mind.</li>\n</ul><ul class=\"story-body__unordered-list\"><li class=\"story-body__list-item\">Sexual orientation is an essential attribute of privacy. Discrimination against an individual on the basis of sexual orientation is deeply offensive to the dignity and self-worth of the individual.

The verdict is remarkable because, as scholar Pratap Bhanu Mehta told me, it \"asks us to look at a system of rights as an interconnected whole\" rather than dealing with them in isolation. </p><p>What appears to be less clear are the implications the judgement will have on the use of state power in collecting personal information. For one, it recognises that there are compelling state interests in collecting such information. </p><p>It talks about a \"careful and sensitive balance between individual interests and legitimate concerns of the state\" like national security, prevention and investigation of crime and ensuring social welfare benefits reach those they are intended for, a point seized upon by the ruling BJP government in its response to the judgement.  The verdict supports a \"careful balancing of the requirements of privacy coupled with other values which the protection of data sub-serves together with the legitimate concerns of the state\".</p><p>These caveats raise a number of questions.</p><figure class=\"media-landscape has-caption full-width\">\n<span class=\"image-and-copyright-container\">\n<div class=\"js-delayed-image-load\" data-alt=\"Supreme Court\" data-height=\"600\" data-src=\"https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/320/cpsprodpb/E146/production/_97507675_mediaitem97507674.jpg\" data-width=\"976\"></div>\n<span class=\"off-screen\">Image copyright</span>\n<span class=\"story-image-copyright\">AFP</span>\n</span>\n<figcaption class=\"media-caption\">\n<span class=\"off-screen\">Image caption</span>\n<span class=\"media-caption__text\">\n                    The top court overturned two previous judgements\n                </span>\n</figcaption>\n</figure><p>How will be the biometric ID card-based litigations be adjudicated in the light of Thursday's verdict? (A smaller bench will now look into the validity of the Aadhaar scheme, the largest biometric identity scheme in the world.) Will the state agencies will be given carte blanche to make this data mandatory to access benefits? What about the information that has already been collected and shared across databases? How do you balance competing public and private interests when the government links the ID to tax returns to supposedly prevent fraud and evasion and private mobile networks using the ID to sign up consumers? Also, what about media intrusion into public lives? </p><p>\"What India still needs is a detailed and transparent information architecture detailing which agency or vendor shares what information with whom, and a proper privacy architecture and how you can protect yourself if the state messes with your identity,\" says Dr Mehta, former president of India's Centre for Policy Research think-tank and now vice-chancellor of Ashoka University. </p><p>\"And, to be fair, that's not something that the court can adjudicate upon.\"</p><p>Many believe Thursday's judgement is a wake-up call for the government.

The credibility contest is key. </p><p>I wonder how many journalists have arrived in Washington over the years dreaming of becoming the next Bob Woodward. Hoping that they'll be invited to descend into some subterranean car park, where a high-ranking contact, another \"Deep Throat\", mutters cryptic, and not-so cryptic instructions: \"follow the money\". Perhaps they've imagined being played in a movie by a Robert Redford or his female equivalent. Perhaps they have fantasised about bringing down a president. </p><p>Working alongside Carl Bernstein - who came to be played, of course, by Dustin Hoffman in All the President's Men - Bob Woodward set the journalistic bar that high. His shoe leather reporting following the break-in at the Democratic National Committee headquarters in the Watergate complex in June 1972 was a principal reason for the fall of Richard Nixon. </p><p>Carl Bernstein went on to become a celebrity journalist: a black-tie regular on the New York cocktail circuit, a summer fixture in the Hamptons, an object of fascination for the Big Apple tabloid gossip columns. </p><p>But one of the reasons why Bob Woodward has achieved such stature in the forty years since Nixon flashed that bizarre victory salute from the South Lawn of the White House as he exited the presidency is that he never sought to become Robert Redford, but remained avowedly Bob Woodward. </p><div aria-hidden=\"true\" class=\"bbccom_slot mpu-ad\" id=\"bbccom_mpu_1_2_3\">\n<div class=\"bbccom_advert\">\n<script type=\"text/javascript\">\n            /**/\n            (function() {\n                if (window.bbcdotcom && bbcdotcom.adverts && bbcdotcom.adverts.slotAsync) {\n                    bbcdotcom.adverts.slotAsync('mpu', [1,2,3]);\n                }\n            })();\n            /**/\n        </script>\n</div>\n</div><ul class=\"story-body__unordered-list\">\n<li class=\"story-body__list-item\"><a class=\"story-body__link\" href=\"https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-us-canada-45415151\">Five explosive quotes from Fear</a></li>\n<li class=\"story-body__list-item\"><a class=\"story-body__link\" href=\"https://www.bbc.com/news/world-us-canada-45417959\">Trump condemns Woodward book as 'con'</a></li>\n<li class=\"story-body__list-item\"><a class=\"story-body__link\" href=\"https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-us-canada-39826934\">White House revolving door - who's gone?</a></li>\n</ul><p>Though his books are often sensational, he is the opposite of sensationalist. He's diligent, rigorous, fastidious about the facts, and studiously ethical. There's something almost monastic about his method. Indeed, a criticism of his books is that the prose can be flat and lifeless, a reflection of his steady state emotion. </p><p>The topics of Woodward's presidential studies can also sometimes be dry. His book on Bill Clinton focused not on the drama of Monica Lewinsky or impeachment but rather discussions on the budget deficit, welfare reform and healthcare. With Obama, it wasn't the romance of America's Black Camelot, but the handling of the wars in Afghanistan and Iraq, and the quest for fiscal rectitude. One of the reasons he's taken so seriously is that he covers the serious work of government.</p><p>Nor has his focus solely been the West Wing. After All the President's Men and The Final Days, his Nixonian bestsellers, came The Brethren, which studied the Supreme Court. Veil, published in 1987, looked at the secret wars of the CIA. The Commanders focused on the Pentagon during the first Gulf War. Maestro, his biography of Alan Greenspan, probed the recondite world of The Federal Reserve.</p><figure class=\"media-landscape has-caption full-width\">\n<span class=\"image-and-copyright-container\">\n<div class=\"js-delayed-image-load\" data-alt=\"Robert Redford and Bob Woodward\" data-height=\"549\" data-src=\"https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/320/cpsprodpb/B1B2/production/_103309454_capture.jpg\" data-width=\"976\"></div>\n<span class=\"off-screen\">Image copyright</span>\n<span class=\"story-image-copyright\">Getty Images</span>\n</span>\n<figcaption class=\"media-caption\">\n<span class=\"off-screen\">Image caption</span>\n<span class=\"media-caption__text\">\n                    Robert Redford alongside the reporter he portrayed in the film All The President's Men\n                </span>\n</figcaption>\n</figure><p>Though Woodward is a consummate Washington insider, there's also a sense of detachment about his work. He rarely troubles himself with the day-to-day. He doesn't become consumed by the controversy of the hour. His Twitter account registers just 93 tweets since he joined the social media platform in 2013. He tries assiduously to remain above the fray. And at a time when commentary has become so overblown, when the language of Washington debate has become so hysterical and extreme, this seventy-five year old has remained the straight man. </p><p>The most vivid passages of his books usually come from the quotes of his high-level sources. That's certainly true of Fear. It's John Kelly the chief of staff, who describes the Trump White House as \"Crazytown\". It's James Mattis who apparently mocks the president as a 5th or 6th grader - a ten year old. Mattis has denied saying those things. Kelly says he didn't call the president an \"idiot\". But try winning a credibility contest against Bob Woodward, one of America's most trusted journalists. </p><p>So detailed are his studies - and so well-sourced - that they've become part of the historical record. His trilogy of books on George W Bush - Bush at War, Plan of Attack and State of Denial - have not yet been bettered. The Commanders remains a classic.</p><hr class=\"story-body__line\"/><h2 class=\"story-body__crosshead\">More from Nick</h2><ul class=\"story-body__unordered-list\">\n<li class=\"story-body__list-item\"><a class=\"story-body__link\" href=\"https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-us-canada-41826022\">The time America stopped being great</a></li>\n<li class=\"story-body__list-item\"><a class=\"story-body__link\" href=\"https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-us-canada-39724045\">The two faces of Trump's America</a></li>\n<li class=\"story-body__list-item\"><a class=\"story-body__link\" href=\"https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-us-canada-43507701\">An incomplete history of US protest</a></li>\n</ul><hr class=\"story-body__line\"/><p>Long before the presidential libraries undertake their own oral history projects, chronicling the reflections, grudges and grievances of former administration officials, the key players have usually shared their thoughts with Bob Woodward. Christopher Hitchens once derided him as \"the stenographer of the rich and the powerful\" but it's his access that explains why the Woodward effect is so impactful; why the publication of his books become news events in their own right.</p><p>The fact that newsrooms in Washington are populated by so many would-be Woodwards has a downside. The desire to topple presidents can lead to journalistic over-reach. B- and c-grade scandals are elevated and exaggerated. Whitewater during the Clinton years is a prime example of that. The \"gate\" suffix has become a dreary cliché, overused and under-thought. Since Watergate, a lot of political coverage has been predicated on the strong suspicion that presidents have surely committed illegal acts or are abusing their power. It's become a recurring line of attack in successive presidencies, and Washington has become more toxic and mistrustful as a result. </p><p>But Woodward himself has not gone down that path. When it comes to bringing down a president, he's been there, done that and even been portrayed in the movie. This history-making journalist has become the Beltway's resident journalist/historian. Bob Woodward has become an institution. He's Washington's chronicler in chief.</p>\n</div>"

This is, though, a sometimes bumpy relationship. </p><p>Turkey, as part of its role as guarantor of the Idlib de-escalation zone, has also established about a dozen observation posts in Syrian rebel territory.

Nobody knows quite what Turkey might do if a major regime offensive is unleashed.</p><p>The strains in the alliance of convenience between the Syrian government and Turkey might also be reflected in tensions between Turkey and Russia. </p><p>Relations between the two countries have been complex. In November 2015 Turkey shot down a Russian warplane that it said had intruded into its airspace from Syria. But in September 2017 Turkey signed a deal with Russia to arm its forces with Russian S-400 anti-aircraft missiles.</p><p>Then, in March 2018, units of the Turkish-backed anti-Assad group, the Free Syrian Army, took control of the Syrian Kurdish city of Afrin.</p><p>But Idlib could also open up difficulties between the Syrian government and Moscow. </p><h2 class=\"story-body__crosshead\">What does Russia really want?</h2><p>Russia is the other key overseas player in this drama. It effectively saved President Assad by intervening in the civil war. Russian air power along with Iranian-backed militias and military advisers on the ground enabled him first to stabilise his worsening situation and then to go onto the offensive. </p><p>But what does Russia think of the Idlib situation? On the face of it Russian spokesmen appear to be against a major attack, preferring a negotiated settlement for the province. Russia is eager to scale down its military role in Syria, though its naval build-up in the eastern Mediterranean might suggest otherwise. </p><p>But, as ever in Syria, things are even more complex. Russia may be unable to dissuade its Syrian ally from an Idlib offensive. </p><p>A government assault could amount to a number of different things. These could range from an all-out onslaught to a more restricted effort to nibble away key pieces of territory, to increase pressure on the rebels in those areas that remain. </p><figure class=\"media-landscape has-caption full-width\">\n<span class=\"image-and-copyright-container\">\n<div class=\"js-delayed-image-load\" data-alt=\"A woman carries a child as she sits in front of a tent at a camp for the displaced from the rebel-held Syrian province of Idlib, at the village of al-Ghadfa\" data-height=\"549\" data-src=\"https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/320/cpsprodpb/475B/production/_103276281_gettyimages-1026212556.jpg\" data-width=\"976\"></div>\n<span class=\"off-screen\">Image copyright</span>\n<span class=\"story-image-copyright\">Getty Images</span>\n</span>\n<figcaption class=\"media-caption\">\n<span class=\"off-screen\">Image caption</span>\n<span class=\"media-caption__text\">\n                    More than half of Idlib's population have either fled or been evacuated there from other parts of Syria\n                </span>\n</figcaption>\n</figure><p>Russia retains its enthusiasm for combating \"terrorists\" wherever they may be, and there is no doubt that some of the hardcore elements of the rebels have been forced into Idlib province following setbacks elsewhere.</p><p>The humanitarian consequences of any Idlib offensive would be serious.

I'll just take the paper off his desk' - Gary Cohn</h2><p>Woodward describes several instances where Trump administration officials - chief economic adviser Gary Cohn and White House Staff Secretary Rob Porter, in particular - removed documents from the president's desk to keep Mr Trump from signing them.</p><p>It was all part of a larger effort to insulate the administration, and the nation, from what they saw as Mr Trump's more dangerous impulses. Documents that would have allowed the president to withdraw the nation from the North American Free Trade Agreement and a trade deal with South Korea were hidden - and the US has since committed to renegotiating the pacts. </p><p>Woodward describes these acts as \"no less than an administrative coup d'etat\".</p><figure class=\"media-landscape no-caption full-width\">\n<span class=\"image-and-copyright-container\">\n<div class=\"js-delayed-image-load\" data-alt=\"Short presentational grey line\" data-height=\"50\" data-src=\"https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/320/cpsprodpb/9DFB/production/_101534404_grey_line_new-nc.png\" data-width=\"1333\"></div>\n</span>\n</figure><p><strong>'</strong><strong>Don't testify. It's either that or an orange jumpsuit' - John Dowd</strong></p><p>On 27 January, according to Woodward, the president's personal attorney John Dowd staged a mock interview session with the president to demonstrate what he feared would be the disastrous results if Mr Trump were to sit down with Robert Mueller's special counsel team investigating possible ties between the Trump campaign and Russia.</p><p>It didn't go well, as the president grew increasingly frustrated with the intensity of the questioning, at one point angrily calling the investigation \"a goddamn hoax\".</p><p>Dowd would go on to meet Mr Mueller and reportedly tell him that he couldn't agree to the interview because he didn't want to let the president \"look like an idiot\" and embarrass the nation on the world stage.</p><p>When it later appeared that the president had changed his mind and was going to testify after all, Mr Dowd resigned. </p><figure class=\"media-landscape no-caption full-width\">\n<span class=\"image-and-copyright-container\">\n<div class=\"js-delayed-image-load\" data-alt=\"Short presentational grey line\" data-height=\"50\" data-src=\"https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/320/cpsprodpb/9DFB/production/_101534404_grey_line_new-nc.png\" data-width=\"1333\"></div>\n</span>\n</figure><h2 class=\"story-body__crosshead\">'Let's [expletive] kill him. Let's go in' - Donald Trump </h2><p>One of the sources of considerable consternation for the president's staff, per Woodward, was what they viewed as his dangerous impulses on foreign policy.</p><p>After the US believed the Syrian government had launched another chemical attack in April 2017, Mr Trump told Defence Secretary James Mattis to assassinate President Bashar Assad.</p><p>\"Let's kill the [expletive] lot of them,\" the president reportedly said.</p><p>Mr Mattis acknowledged Mr Trump's request then, after the conversation, told an aide he wouldn't do \"any of that\".</p><p>Woodward says administration officials were also concerned when the president asked for plans for a pre-emptive military strike on North Korea during the height of his feud with Kim Jong-un. The president also dressed down top generals over their handling of the war in Afghanistan, saying that soldiers \"on the ground\" could do a better job.</p><p>\"How many more deaths?\" he asked. \"How many more lost limbs? How much longer are we going to be there?\"</p><figure class=\"media-landscape no-caption full-width\">\n<span class=\"image-and-copyright-container\">\n<div class=\"js-delayed-image-load\" data-alt=\"Short presentational grey line\" data-height=\"50\" data-src=\"https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/320/cpsprodpb/9DFB/production/_101534404_grey_line_new-nc.png\" data-width=\"1333\"></div>\n</span>\n</figure><h2 class=\"story-body__crosshead\">'We're in Crazytown. I don't even know why any of us are here. This is the worst job I've ever had' - John Kelly</h2><p>Woodward paints a picture of a White House staff constantly beaten down and belittled by a temperamental president. </p><p>When White House economic adviser Cohn tried to resign after the president offered sympathetic comments about white nationalists who engaged in a violent August 2017 rally in Charlottesville, Mr Trump accused him of \"treason\". Cohn, according to Woodward, views the president as a \"professional liar\".</p><p>Mr Trump also told Commerce Secretary Wilbur Ross he didn't trust him. \"I don't want you doing any more negotiations,\" the president reportedly said. \"You're past your prime.\"</p><p>He compared his first chief of staff, Reince Priebus, to a rat. \"He just scurries around.\"</p><p>As for Attorney General Jeff Sessions, who the president has publicly berated, privately he was even more disparaging.</p><p>\"This guy is mentally retarded,\" Mr Trump reportedly told staff secretary Porter. \"He's this dumb Southerner. He couldn't even be a one-person country lawyer down in Alabama\".</p><ul class=\"story-body__unordered-list\"><li class=\"story-body__list-item\"><a class=\"story-body__link\" href=\"https://www.bbc.com/news/world-us-canada-45405757\">Trump attacks Sessions over prosecutions</a></li></ul><figure class=\"media-landscape no-caption full-width\">\n<span class=\"image-and-copyright-container\">\n<div class=\"js-delayed-image-load\" data-alt=\"Short presentational grey line\" data-height=\"50\" data-src=\"https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/320/cpsprodpb/9DFB/production/_101534404_grey_line_new-nc.png\" data-width=\"1333\"></div>\n</span>\n</figure><h2 class=\"story-body__crosshead\">'This was no longer a presidency. This is no longer a White House. This is a man being who he is' - Rob Porter</h2><p>If the president was abusive toward his staff, it appears they have got some measure of revenge in the Woodward book, which is chock full of caustic quotes about the president attributed to the aides and advisers who serve him.</p><p>Chief of Staff Kelly repeatedly calls Mr Trump an \"idiot\" and said that \"it's pointless to try to convince him of anything\". Defence Secretary Mattis told an aide that the president has the foreign policy understanding of a \"fifth- or sixth-grader\" (an 11 or 12-year-old).</p><p>Mr Kelly's predecessor, Reince Priebus, describes the presidential bedroom suite as \"the devil's workshop\", where Mr Trump fires off intemperate tweets early in the morning and on weekends.</p><p>Mr Trump's relationship with Rex Tillerson reportedly never recovered after news accounts that the former secretary of state once called the president \"a [expletive] moron\". If that's the case, Woodward's book could cause serious damage within the White House in the coming days.</p><figure class=\"media-landscape no-caption full-width\">\n<span class=\"image-and-copyright-container\">\n<div class=\"js-delayed-image-load\" data-alt=\"Short presentational grey line\" data-height=\"50\" data-src=\"https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/320/cpsprodpb/9DFB/production/_101534404_grey_line_new-nc.png\" data-width=\"1333\"></div>\n</span>\n</figure><h2 class=\"story-body__crosshead\">'Nobody told me about it, and I would've loved to have spoken to you. You know I'm very open to you. I think you've always been fair' - Donald Trump</h2><p>In a pre-emptive strike against what is sure to be a furious White House pushback against the book, <a class=\"story-body__link-external\" href=\"https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/2018/09/04/transcript-phone-call-between-president-trump-journalist-bob-woodward/?utm_term=.bf91a15ba6d3\">the Washington Post released an audio recording and transcript</a> of a call the president made to Woodward in early August. In it, the president claims he was never contacted for an interview or informed of Woodward's soon-to-be-published work - an assertion the reporter successfully rebuts.</p><p>Mr Trump makes several attempts to steer conversation toward his foreign policy achievements and economic record as president.</p><p>\"Nobody's ever done a better job than I'm doing as president,\" he says. \"That I can tell you.\"</p><p>Woodward says through his interviews he \"gained a lot of insight and documentation\" - and that his book would be a \"tough look at the world and your administration and you.\"</p><p>\"I assume that means it's going to be a negative book,\" the president replies.</p><p>Woodward concludes the call by saying \"I believe in our country, and because you're our president, I wish you good luck\".</p><p>If his book is any indication, Woodward probably thinks Mr Trump will need all the luck he can get.</p>\n</div>"

I learned to deeply hate having my picture taken by professionals because there was always a need to make me look childlike and innocent- lacking in anything sexual or appealing. I was convinced I looked like an ugly sickly five year old for the first two years of high school and that that was why guys never seemed to be interested in me in “that” way. It took having a fair amount of relationships and casual sex before I realized that I wasn’t the empty smiling shell of a girl I saw reflected back in pictures. It’s so much easier to believe that sick people are cherubs- held in perpetual youth and innocence- who simply don’t understand the truth of their condition because they are living up in the clouds. Seeing people who are sick as anything more complex and intelligent than that would mean we couldn’t use them as these false beacons of hope. I’ve struggled more with guys, depression drugs, family and career than I ever have with my illness. I’m not an innocent and I’m not a child. I’m not “dying before I have had a chance to live” and what I choose to talk about with the world is not just empty positive falsehoods. Sick people deserve to be seen as more than hollow shells just waiting for their lives to begin.

The Haqqanis have grown from a CIA-backed anti-Soviet group into one of the most feared anti-Western militant organisations in the region, writes the BBC's M Ilyas Khan in Islamabad.</p><p>The so-called Haqqani network of militants has been blamed for several high profile attacks against Western, Indian and government targets in Afghanistan.</p><p>It is often described by Pakistani officials as a predominantly Afghan militant group.</p><p>But its roots reach deep inside Pakistani territory, and speculation over its links to some powerful quarters within the Pakistani security establishment refuse to die down.</p><p>The leader of the group, Jalaluddin Haqqani, is a Jadran tribesman from Afghanistan's Paktia province. He owns properties in the neighbouring North Waziristan tribal region of Pakistan.</p><div aria-hidden=\"true\" class=\"bbccom_slot mpu-ad\" id=\"bbccom_mpu_1_2_3\">\n<div

organised raids against the former Soviet troops that occupied Afghanistan in 1980s.</p><p>American officials admit that Mr Haqqani was a prized asset of the Central Intelligence Agency (CIA) back then.</p><p>He was also one of the favourite commanders of Pakistan's Inter Services Intelligence (ISI) that decided which commander should get how much international funds and equipment to fight the Soviets.</p><p>Many in the West and Pakistan believe he is still an asset of the ISI, though the Pakistani military denies this. </p><p>They say the outreach of the Haqqanis would be far too limited without the material, tactical and logistical support of powerful elements in Pakistan.</p><p>But in a recent interview with the BBC, Jalaluddin Haqqani's son and its current leader, Sirajuddin Haqqani, has said there have \"never been contacts by intelligence agencies of other countries (including Pakistan) which could be effective for us\".</p><h2 class=\"story-body__crosshead\">Bombing campaign</h2><p>A late convert to Taliban, Mr Haqqani was one of their top leaders to undertake a last official visit to Islamabad in late 2001, at about the time as the US started to bomb Afghanistan.</p><p>Mr Haqqani disappeared in Islamabad, and resurfaced several months later in the Waziristan region where he is credited with carving out the first base of militant resistance against Western forces in the most recent conflict in Afghanistan.</p><figure class=\"media-landscape has-caption body-narrow-width\">\n<span class=\"image-and-copyright-container\">\n<div

               </span>\n</figcaption>\n</figure><p>To this day, militants operating out of this base have inflicted more damage than any other group on Western troops in Afghanistan.</p><p>The more lethal of these militants are the Pakistani fighters, called Punjabi Taliban by locals in Waziristan, and the so-called foreign fighters of Arab and central Asian origin.</p><p>These fighters constitute the bulk of Haqqani network's fighting force.</p><p>The growing strength of Waziristan-based militants is seen as having turned the tide against the Americans in Afghanistan in recent years.</p><p>Waziristan is seen as the source of Taliban resistance in Kunar and Ningarhar provinces in the north-east of the country, and in the southern militant strongholds of Zabul, Kandahar and Helmand.</p><p>When the Americans started their bombing campaign in Afghanistan in late October 2001, thousands of Arab and Central Asian fighters started to pour into South Waziristan.</p><p>Some half-hearted attempts by the Pakistani army to check this influx led to a violent conflict in the Wana region of South Waziristan in 2002, and again in 2004.</p><p>More than 700 Pakistani soldiers were killed in those clashes.</p><p>Subsequently, Pakistanis backed down and allowed militant groups to establish deeper roots there.</p><p>By 2006, several local militant groups had emerged across the whole of South Waziristan and North Waziristan, converting the entire area into a virtual no-go zone for Pakistani officials.</p><h2 class=\"story-body__crosshead\">Civilian targets</h2><p>Based in different geographical locations within the region, these groups had different, sometimes conflicting, aims and agendas.</p><p>Some of these groups signed peace deals with the Pakistani army, which still hold.</p><p>Others were hostile to it and conducted violent campaigns against government and civilian targets in Pakistani cities and towns. </p><p>But all groups were largely under the influence of the Haqqanis, and like them, professed allegiance to Mullah Omar, the Taliban's spiritual leader.</p><p>Jalaluddin Haqqani's son, Sirajuddin, was the chief negotiator who united various clans of the Ahmadzai Wazir tribe in Wana region of South Waziristan in 2006.</p><p>He is also believed to have been instrumental in persuading Baitullah Mehsud, the anti-Pakistan militant commander based in eastern parts of South Waziristan, to negotiate peace with the Pakistani forces in 2005 and again in 2008.</p><p>While these peace deals did not hold, collaboration between the Haqqanis and Mehsud's TTP group continued.</p><p>They were both blamed for organising a December 2009 suicide attack in Khost province of Afghanistan in which seven CIA operatives were killed.</p><p>There is evidence that some top members of the Haqqani network have also been operating in the Pakistani mainland, away from their sanctuary in the Waziristan region.</p><p>Between 2008 and 2011, two brothers of Jalaluddin Haqqani, along with some other leaders of the group, have been trying to negotiate peace between the TTP - now headed by Hakimullah Mehsud - and the Shia Turi tribe of the Kurram tribal region.</p><p>At least three rounds of talks have so far been held in Peshawar, the capital of the north-western Khyber Pakhtunkhwa province, and in Islamabad.</p><p>This serves as an indication of the extent to which the Haqqanis can influence and shape the militant scene in Pakistan and the freedom with which they can move both within the semi-autonomous tribal areas and the Pakistani and Afghan mainlands.</p>\n</div>"

Badly injured - having fractured both arms and a leg when he ejected - he was captured by North Vietnamese troops.</p><p>He was refused all but the most rudimentary medical care, and interrogated under torture. The beatings only stopped when the North Vietnamese discovered he was the son of an admiral. In March 1968, he was placed in solitary confinement where he remained for two years.</p><h2 class=\"story-body__crosshead\">Badly injured</h2><p>When his father became commander of US forces in Vietnam, his captors - sensing a propaganda opportunity - offered to release him. McCain refused unless every US prisoner captured before him was released first.</p><p>His captors restarted the brutal torture regime to the extent that McCain, beaten and suffering from dysentery, attempted suicide.

And I don't want this blog to come across as faux naïve. I've covered politics for long enough to know that politicians will try to shape and mould truth to best suit their purposes, to allow them to weaponise the facts that will give them greatest advantage. </p><p>And I know that politicians love transparency when it best suits them. But in the past two weeks, a line has been crossed. </p><p>Let me start with something seemingly minor. I was listening to the president and Theresa May at their news conference in the Chequers garden when Donald Trump, talking about Brexit, suddenly made the statement that he had predicted the result when he was at his golf course in Turnberry for the opening of his wonderful golf course the day before the EU referendum in June 2016. </p><ul class=\"story-body__unordered-list\">\n<li class=\"story-body__list-item\"><a class=\"story-body__link\" href=\"/news/world-us-canada-44827396\">The Wacky Races of news conferences</a></li>\n<li class=\"story-body__list-item\"><a class=\"story-body__link\" href=\"/news/uk-scotland-scotland-politics-44826229\">How Scotland braced for Trump's arrival</a></li>\n<li class=\"story-body__list-item\"><a class=\"story-body__link\" href=\"/news/uk-scotland-44810023\">Why US presidents love the home of golf</a></li>\n</ul><p>I sat up with a jolt. I had been there with him on that trip. </p><div aria-hidden=\"true\" class=\"bbccom_slot mpu-ad\" id=\"bbccom_mpu_1_2_3\">\n<div class=\"bbccom_advert\">\n<script type=\"text/javascript\">\n            /**/\n            (function() {\n                if (window.bbcdotcom && bbcdotcom.adverts && bbcdotcom.adverts.slotAsync) {\n                    bbcdotcom.adverts.slotAsync('mpu', [1,2,3]);\n                }\n            })();\n            /**/\n        </script>\n</div>\n</div><p>We didn't arrive until the day after the referendum.

Who doesn't do that occasionally? - although maybe not on something as fundamental as that. </p><figure class=\"media-landscape has-caption full-width\">\n<span class=\"image-and-copyright-container\">\n<div class=\"js-delayed-image-load\" data-alt=\"Trump returned to his golf resort in Scotland on his most recent visit to the UK\" data-height=\"649\" data-src=\"https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/320/cpsprodpb/A937/production/_102691334_gettyimages-998542330.jpg\" data-width=\"976\"></div>\n<span class=\"off-screen\">Image copyright</span>\n<span class=\"story-image-copyright\">Getty Images</span>\n</span>\n<figcaption class=\"media-caption\">\n<span class=\"off-screen\">Image caption</span>\n<span class=\"media-caption__text\">\n                    Trump returned to his golf resort in Scotland on his most recent visit to the UK\n                </span>\n</figcaption>\n</figure><p>Anyway back to my tweet saying the president was factually incorrect. Straight back shot Stephanie Grisham, who is the first lady's director of communications, but more importantly at the time was Donald Trump's press person for the trip to Turnberry. </p><p>She told me on Twitter the president was right to say what he had said - and she had the photos to prove it. </p><div class=\"social-embed\"><div class=\"social-embed-unavailable\">\n<p>Content is not available</p>\n</div></div><p>So we produced the tweet from the president on the 24th saying \"Just arrived in Scotland…\" and from her saying that she had just arrived in Scotland. </p><p>Someone else found the flight manifest, confirming that the Trump private jet had arrived on the 24th. I fully agree a storm in a teacup. This is not the sort of thing on which world peace hinges. </p><p>But I struggle to fathom Steph's motives. Why did she go wading in to defend a lie? And why when the proof was provided that she was incorrect did she not just say \"fair enough - my mistake\". </p><div class=\"social-embed\"><div class=\"social-embed-unavailable\">\n<p>Content is not available</p>\n</div></div><p>Psychology has a rather good word for this - \"gaslighting\". </p><p>This is the Wikipedia definition of it: Gaslighting is a form of psychological manipulation that seeks to sow seeds of doubt in a targeted individual or in members of a targeted group, making them question their own memory, perception, and sanity. Using persistent denial, misdirection, contradiction, and lying, it attempts to destabilise the victim and delegitimise the victim's belief.</p><p>From Chequers we now go to Helsinki, and another extraordinary news conference this time with Vladimir Putin. The whole thing was slightly surreal, made more so by the guy sitting next to me being yanked out by the Secret Service after it became clear to them he was planning some kind of protest during the news conference. </p><p>During the course of the Q and A, Jeff Mason from Reuters was called to ask a question. He wanted to know whether Putin had wanted Donald Trump to win the 2016 presidential election and had directed any of his officials to help him do that?</p><p>Vladimir Putin didn't hesitate: \"Yes, I wanted him to win because he talked about bringing the US-Russia relationship back to normal.\"</p><ul class=\"story-body__unordered-list\">\n<li class=\"story-body__list-item\"><a class=\"story-body__link\" href=\"/news/world-us-canada-44857897\">Trump-Putin: Your toolkit to help understand the story</a></li>\n<li class=\"story-body__list-item\"><a class=\"story-body__link\" href=\"/news/world-us-canada-42493918\">All you need to know about Trump Russia story</a></li>\n</ul><p>It was quite a moment. But then I saw a tweet that Donald Trump put out yesterday to protest about how tough he was with Russia, <a class=\"story-body__link-external\" href=\"https://twitter.com/realDonaldTrump/status/1021784726217142273\">which read:</a></p><p>\"I'm very concerned that Russia will be fighting very hard to have an impact on the upcoming Election. Based on the fact that no President has been tougher on Russia than me, they will be pushing very hard for the Democrats. They definitely don't want Trump!\"</p><p>So I referred back to what Putin had said in Helsinki a week earlier. But here's where it gets super murky. All reference to that exchange between Mr Mason and the Russian leader has been omitted from the official White House transcript. In the official record it doesn't exist. </p><p>Just a clerical transcription error? Well maybe -<a class=\"story-body__link-external\" href=\"https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/politics/wp/2018/07/25/no-the-white-house-didnt-intentionally-edit-a-question-to-putin-out-of-a-video/\"> there is some confusion over the translation,</a> but maybe it would be good to correct the record. </p><figure class=\"media-landscape no-caption full-width\">\n<span class=\"image-and-copyright-container\">\n<div class=\"js-delayed-image-load\" data-alt=\"Trump with Scottish bag pipes\" data-height=\"649\" data-src=\"https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/320/cpsprodpb/1689F/production/_102691329_gettyimages-542736486.jpg\" data-width=\"976\"></div>\n<span class=\"off-screen\">Image copyright</span>\n<span class=\"story-image-copyright\">Getty Images</span>\n</span>\n</figure><p>Now for another random event which happened yesterday. The White House has said that it will no longer provide information about when the president holds conversations with foreign leaders, as it has always done hitherto. </p><p>The accounts of the chats may have been anodyne and terse, but they were a useful tool to keep track of foreign policy priorities. And it was always useful to compare and contrast what, say, the Kremlin would have to say about the conversation compared to the White House. Now we will no longer be able to do that. </p><p>And so to the final thing. Donald Trump was speaking at a rally in Kansas City. And he came out with a memorable phrase that sounded as though it had been lifted straight from George Orwell's dystopian novel, 1984. He said: \"Just remember, what you are seeing and what you are reading is not what's happening.\" </p><p>Or it is. There is just a concerted - and sometimes it would seem - systematic effort to make you think otherwise. </p><p>Forget alternative facts. This is rewriting history.</p>\n</div>"

They say there is a strong case for a genocide prosecution, and emphasise that accountability for the military inside Myanmar is impossible, and must therefore be pursued by the international community.</p><p>Expect more energetic diplomacy at the UN, both in the Security Council and the General Assembly, to find a way to do this. The Myanmar government has rejected previous international reports documenting abuses against the Rohingya, but this one, compiled over more than a year, headed by three respected international legal experts, and likely to get public support at the UN, will be harder to dismiss.</p><ul class=\"story-body__unordered-list\"><li class=\"story-body__list-item\"><a class=\"story-body__link\" href=\"https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-asia-41975331\">Myanmar army report clears itself of blame</a></li></ul><p>The report also condemns all of Myanmar's own inquiries into the abuses as worthless, making it harder for the government to take refuge behind them. The report compounds Myanmar's international isolation and puts its military leaders in the very worst category of human rights abusers, but will not significantly change the dynamics inside the country.</p><p><strong>Imogen Foulkes:</strong> The UN investigators say the situation in Myanmar should be referred to the International Criminal Court, a move which would have to be approved by the UN Security Council. It is more than likely that one of the five permanent council members, China, would veto such a move. Failing a referral to the ICC, the investigators suggest an independent criminal tribunal should be set up, as with Rwanda or former Yugoslavia.</p><div aria-hidden=\"true\" class=\"bbccom_slot mpu-ad\" id=\"bbccom_mpu_1_2_3\">\n<div class=\"bbccom_advert\">\n<script type=\"text/javascript\">\n            /**/\n            (function() {\n                if (window.bbcdotcom && bbcdotcom.adverts && bbcdotcom.adverts.slotAsync) {\n                    bbcdotcom.adverts.slotAsync('mpu', [1,2,3]);\n                }\n            })();\n            /**/\n        </script>\n</div>\n</div><figure class=\"media-with-caption\">\n<div class=\"player-with-placeholder\">\n<img class=\"media-placeholder player-with-placeholder__image narrative-video-placeholder\" src=\"https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/images/ic/720x405/p06jdk43.jpg\"/>\n<div class=\"player-with-placeholder__caption\">Media playback is unsupported on your device</div>\n<div class=\"player-with-placeholder\">\n<div class=\"media-player-wrapper\">\n<figure class=\"js-media-player-unprocessed media-player\" data-playable='{\"settings\":{\"counterName\":\"news.world.asia.story.45324092.page\",\"edition\":\"Asia\",\"pageType\":\"eav2\",\"uniqueID\":\"45324092\",\"ui\":{\"locale\":{\"lang\":\"en-gb\"}},\"externalEmbedUrl\":\"https:\\/\\/www.bbc.com\\/news\\/av\\/embed\\/p06jdjkg\\/45324092\",\"insideIframe\":false,\"statsObject\":{\"clipPID\":\"p06jdjkd\"},\"playlistObject\":{\"title\":\"Rohingya girls in danger: The stories of three young women\",\"holdingImageURL\":\"https:\\/\\/ichef.bbci.co.uk\\/images\\/ic\\/$recipe\\/p06jdk43.jpg\",\"guidance\":\"\",\"embedRights\":\"allowed\",\"summary\":\"Rohingya girls in danger: The stories of three young women\",\"liveRewind\":false,\"simulcast\":false,\"items\":[{\"vpid\":\"p06jdjkg\",\"live\":false,\"duration\":195,\"kind\":\"programme\"}]}},\"otherSettings\":{\"advertisingAllowed\":true,\"continuousPlayCfg\":{\"enabled\":false},\"isAutoplayOnForAudience\":false}}'></figure>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div> <figcaption class=\"media-with-caption__caption\"><span class=\"off-screen\">Media caption</span>Rohingya girls in danger: The stories of three young women</figcaption>\n</figure><p>Such a tribunal could in theory be created by the UN General Assembly, avoiding a Security Council veto. For a tribunal to really function, however, Myanmar would have to co-operate, by ensuring that those indicted did turn up for trial. It took many years, and promises of a closer relationship with the EU, before Serbia and Croatia handed over their suspected war criminals to the Hague's tribunal.</p><h2 class=\"story-body__crosshead\">Has the UN played its trump card? Are there precedents?</h2><p><strong>Imogen Foulkes:</strong> By naming six senior military figures, including the commander in chief of Myanmar's armed forces and his deputy, this UN team has gone further than any other. There have been many investigations into war crimes in Syria, and we know there is a long list of suspects, including, it is thought, very senior figures in the Syrian military and the government. But their names have never been made public. </p><p>The Myanmar investigators must believe they can achieve something by naming names. Within hours of the report being published, there have already been consequences. The European Union is to hold a meeting this week, and will hear in person from the UN team. Facebook has removed accounts associated with Myanmar military leaders. A key concern in the UN report is the dissemination of misinformation designed to incite hate.</p><p>Other possible actions could include sanctions, something the UN investigators also call for. The EU, or the UN Security Council, could impose travel bans on those named in the report, and could also freeze their financial assets. </p><h2 class=\"story-body__crosshead\">Could anyone - including Aung Sang Suu Kyi - actually be convicted?</h2><p><strong>Imogen Foulkes</strong>: No-one can be convicted without the ICC or another form of tribunal. The UN team can investigate, but not prosecute. But the sheer weight of evidence gathered suggests there will have to be some form of prosecution, although it could be many years away.</p><figure class=\"media-landscape has-caption full-width\">\n<span class=\"image-and-copyright-container\">\n<div class=\"js-delayed-image-load\" data-alt=\"Commander-in-chief Min Aung Hlaing with Aung San Suu Kyi\" data-height=\"549\" data-src=\"https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/320/cpsprodpb/D748/production/_102221155_15d09ef7-46cf-416a-84b0-54cab8c6992b.jpg\" data-width=\"976\"></div>\n<span class=\"off-screen\">Image copyright</span>\n<span class=\"story-image-copyright\">Reuters</span>\n</span>\n<figcaption class=\"media-caption\">\n<span class=\"off-screen\">Image caption</span>\n<span class=\"media-caption__text\">\n                    Commander-in-chief Min Aung Hlaing, shaking hands with Aung San Suu Kyi\n                </span>\n</figcaption>\n</figure><p><strong>Jonathan Head</strong>: It's very unlikely Aung Sang Suu Kyi will face prosecution. The report acknowledges that the civilian government has no authority over the military in Myanmar, and that there is no evidence it knew of the military's plans to attack the Rohingya population. It does accuse her of failing to use her moral authority to curb the abuses, and says her government contributed to the crimes in Rakhine state by spreading false narratives, blocking independent investigations and denying the military's wrongdoing.</p><ul class=\"story-body__unordered-list\">\n<li class=\"story-body__list-item\"><a class=\"story-body__link\" href=\"/news/world-asia-42335018\">Could Aung San Suu Kyi face Rohingya genocide charges?</a></li>\n<li class=\"story-body__list-item\"><a class=\"story-body__link\" href=\"/news/world-asia-41222210\">Seeing through the official story in Myanmar</a></li>\n</ul><p>The authors say their main focus for prosecutions must be on the military, which it finds primarily responsible. Perhaps the worst effect of this for Ms Suu Kyi is that she now finds herself in the same camp as men accused of the very worst human rights crimes, because she has insisted on backing the military's version of events in Rakhine. </p><p>She could conceivably have supported the military's right to respond robustly to attacks by Rohingya militants last year while leaving the door open to credible investigations of human rights violations. She did not, and her international reputation has gone from being tarnished last year, to being shattered by this report.</p><p><strong>Imogen Foulkes:</strong> The UN may be hoping that this report helps Aung San Suu Kyi understand that if she wants to stay in power, or to exercise power more meaningfully than she has done so far, then she must support war crimes prosecutions. A first step could be for her to back the investigators' call for the resignation of Commander in Chief Min Aung Hlaing.</p><h2 class=\"story-body__crosshead\">Why is it so rare for the UN to use the word genocide? </h2><p><strong>Imogen Foulkes:</strong> Genocide is a very specific crime under international law. To show that genocide has occurred, intent to exterminate an entire group must be shown. Random violence, an army rampaging through a village, would not constitute genocide. But a co-ordinated campaign, with a clear line of command from senior generals to troops on the ground to persecute, kill, or deport a group (usually based on race, religion or ethnicity) would.</p><p>In the case of Myanmar, the investigators said that factors \"pointing at such intent include the broader oppressive context and hate rhetoric; specific utterances of commanders and direct perpetrators; exclusionary policies, including to alter the demographic composition of Rakhine state; the level of organization indicating a plan for destruction; and the extreme scale and brutality of the violence\".</p><p><a class=\"story-body__link\" href=\"/news/world-11108059\">Read more: Why the word 'genocide' is used so carefully</a></p><h2 class=\"story-body__crosshead\">What does this mean for the hundreds of thousands of Rohingya refugees? </h2><p><strong>Jonathan Head: </strong>The situation for Rohingya on both sides of the border with Bangladesh is dire. Inside Rakhine they live in fear, without legal status and subject to arbitrary restrictions on their movements and possibly worse. About 140,000 are confined to dismal camps, where they fled in the communal violence of 2012, whereas the much smaller number of Rakhine people displaced by the conflict have been re-housed or able to go back to their homes.</p><figure class=\"media-landscape has-caption full-width\">\n<span class=\"image-and-copyright-container\">\n<div class=\"js-delayed-image-load\" data-alt=\"girl looking out from a makeshift shelter\" data-height=\"549\" data-src=\"https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/320/cpsprodpb/EA1D/production/_98733995_rohingyagirl.jpg\" data-width=\"976\"></div>\n<span class=\"off-screen\">Image copyright</span>\n<span class=\"story-image-copyright\">AFP/ Getty Images</span>\n</span>\n<figcaption class=\"media-caption\">\n<span class=\"off-screen\">Image caption</span>\n<span class=\"media-caption__text\">\n                    Hundreds of thousands of Rohingya people are now living in refugee camps like this one in Bangladesh\n                </span>\n</figcaption>\n</figure><p>In Bangladesh the population of refugees is many times too large for the area of land they occupy. They are sustained by a massive international aid effort, which at least offers food, shelter, education and medical treatment - the last two near-impossible to obtain when they lived in Myanmar. </p><p>But they are constantly vulnerable to weather, environmental degradation, the abuses of organised gangs within the camps, and to the possibility that Bangladesh may one day make good its threat to move them all to a semi-submerged island which is even less suitable.</p><p>The two countries have agreed to repatriate the refugees, but Myanmar is still tightly restricting access to Rakhine for most international agencies, and unwilling to address the terrible abuses that forced the Rohingya to flee. </p><p>Buddhist resentment of the Rohingya in Rakhine has hardened and no effort is being made to persuade them to accept them back. In these conditions a return to Rakhine for the Rohingya is impossible to imagine, and they are stuck in limbo. A huge diaspora living in squalid camps can spell trouble in the long-term, as the fate of Palestinian refugees suggests.</p>\n</div>"

James Ricketson has been an outspoken critic of the government of Hun Sen. </p><p>In the past that was not a problem, when Cambodia enjoyed one of the freest media environments in South East Asia  following the UN-supervised peace agreement of the early 1990s. </p><p>But in recent years Hun Sen has become intolerant of criticism, accused of using the courts to lock up activists, and most recently, the main opposition leader Kem Sokha on a charge of colluding with the US to overthrow the government. </p><p>Little evidence had been produced to back that charge, or the charge against Ricketson. But both men are still incarcerated, and are likely to remain in jail until they are no longer deemed a threat.  </p><p>With the main opposition party banned, Hun Sen easily won the most recent general election in July. His increasingly authoritarian rule has been widely condemned by western governments, but Cambodia no longer needs their aid as its economy is dominated by China. </p><p>The veteran Prime Minister has shown leniency after that election victory, releasing some of his critics. It is possible he will do the same for James Ricketson before the end of his six-year sentence.</p><hr class=\"story-body__line\"/><p>His family has expressed dismay over the verdict stating: \"James is not a spy. James loves Cambodia and the Cambodian people. He is a filmmaker and a humanitarian\".</p><p>The filmmaker's lawyer told media that if the verdict is upheld, the Australian government should take diplomatic action. </p><h2 class=\"story-body__crosshead\">Authoritarian crackdown</h2><p>The ruling comes as observers increasingly accuse Cambodia's government of authoritarian rule to suppress dissent. </p><figure class=\"media-landscape has-caption full-width\">\n<span class=\"image-and-copyright-container\">\n<div class=\"js-delayed-image-load\" data-alt=\"This file photo taken on September 3, 2017 shows Cambodian opposition leader Kem Sokha (L) being escorted by police at his home in Phnom Penh\" data-height=\"549\" data-src=\"https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/320/cpsprodpb/C41F/production/_97670205_8f202865-4162-49cd-9ee3-e124b2f6666f.jpg\" data-width=\"976\"></div>\n<span class=\"off-screen\">Image copyright</span>\n<span class=\"story-image-copyright\">AFP/Getty Images</span>\n</span>\n<figcaption class=\"media-caption\">\n<span class=\"off-screen\">Image caption</span>\n<span class=\"media-caption__text\">\n                    Opposition leader Kem Sokha has been charged with treason\n                </span>\n</figcaption>\n</figure><ul class=\"story-body__unordered-list\"><li class=\"story-body__list-item\"><a class=\"story-body__link\" href=\"/news/world-asia-44999358\">Cambodia ruling party claims landslide</a></li></ul><p>The opposition Cambodia National Rescue Party (CNRP) behind the rally Mr Ricketson was filming has since been banned, leaving the government without any serious political opponent. </p><p>In this year's general election, Hun Sen's ruling party claimed a landslide victory, but it was a poll that was widely criticised for its failure to allow serious opposition.</p><p>Hun Sen, a former soldier in the Khmer Rouge who later opposed them, has presided over a sustained period of rapid economic growth.</p><p>But he has long been accused of using the courts and security forces to crush dissent and intimidate critics.</p>\n</div>"

They have reached decisions on the cases of at least 1,000 people, who are now in six detention centres across Assam. </p><p>The government is yet to release information on the status of the remaining cases. </p><p>Illegal migration from Bangladesh to India's north-east, including Assam, has always been a serious concern. Estimates of illegal foreigners range from four million to 10 million - and they have a sizeable presence in at least 15 of Assam's 33 districts. Most of them are engaged in agriculture.</p><p>Mr Das says his parents arrived from Bangladesh in the 1960s and they died a few years ago. He says he was born in India but the court classified him as a \"doubtful Indian citizen\", claiming that his documents did not prove it. </p><p>Although the citizenship of Mr Das's wife has not been questioned, their two children have been found to be illegal citizens. The couple have hired a lawyer to challenge the government's decision but Mr Das says that is costing them a lot of money. </p><p>Although those who have been declared foreigners can appeal the decision, it will be a lengthy process that could take months or even years. Until they get a final decision on their legal status, Mr Das and his family will have to live in limbo. </p><p>However it is unclear what will happen to them even if they lose the appeal as India has no official treaty with Bangladesh in relation to cross-border illegal immigration.</p><figure class=\"media-landscape has-caption full-width\">\n<span class=\"image-and-copyright-container\">\n<div class=\"js-delayed-image-load\" data-alt=\"The detention camp is located inside Assam's central prison\" data-height=\"549\" data-src=\"https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/320/cpsprodpb/A3DD/production/_103194914_jail_wide-1.jpg\" data-width=\"976\"></div>\n</span>\n<figcaption class=\"media-caption\">\n<span class=\"off-screen\">Image caption</span>\n<span class=\"media-caption__text\">\n                    The detention camp is located inside Assam's central prison\n                </span>\n</figcaption>\n</figure><p>Earlier this month, the Indian government published a list of Assam's proven citizens, which left out the names of some four million people. This has complicated the situation further as the government is yet to clarify if the two processes overlap in any way. </p><p>Meanwhile, Mr Das is afraid that his bail might be cancelled at any time, forcing him to return to the camp.  </p><p>He says the camp was a large but cramped room in a red building that houses a prison. All the detention camps in Assam are located within a prison compound. </p><p>Mr Das recalls at least 35 people eating and sleeping in the single room that was the Silchar camp. And they all used one toilet which had no locks - they waited for 30 minutes every morning for their turn.  </p><p>He was woken up each morning at 05:00 (23:30 GMT) by a thunderous shout. He had to be ready within the hour or he would miss the daily cup of tea served with two biscuits. Everyone was then ushered out of the room to spend the day out in the open ground surrounded by 40ft (12m) high brick walls.</p><p>Lunch comprised of rice, pulses and a vegetable, while dinner was hurriedly served before 17:00. They had to return indoors by 18:00, after which the doors would be locked. </p><p>Outside the camp, people can be seen queuing through the day to meet family members who were inside the walls. Most of them will meet for just 10 minutes, separated by a row of thick iron rods. Those who can afford it buy themselves some extra time. </p><figure class=\"media-with-caption\">\n<div class=\"player-with-placeholder\">\n<img class=\"media-placeholder player-with-placeholder__image narrative-video-placeholder\" src=\"https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/images/ic/720x405/p06g29nh.jpg\"/>\n<div class=\"player-with-placeholder__caption\">Media playback is unsupported on your device</div>\n<div class=\"player-with-placeholder\">\n<div class=\"media-player-wrapper\">\n<figure class=\"js-media-player-unprocessed media-player\" data-playable=\"{&quot;settings&quot;:{&quot;counterName&quot;:&quot;news.world.asia.india.story.45192701.page&quot;,&quot;edition&quot;:&quot;Asia&quot;,&quot;pageType&quot;:&quot;eav2&quot;,&quot;uniqueID&quot;:&quot;45192701&quot;,&quot;ui&quot;:{&quot;locale&quot;:{&quot;lang&quot;:&quot;en-gb&quot;}},&quot;externalEmbedUrl&quot;:&quot;https:\\/\\/www.bbc.com\\/news\\/av\\/embed\\/p06g284l\\/45192701&quot;,&quot;insideIframe&quot;:false,&quot;statsObject&quot;:{&quot;clipPID&quot;:&quot;p06g284j&quot;},&quot;playlistObject&quot;:{&quot;title&quot;:&quot;Living in limbo: Assam's four million unwanted&quot;,&quot;holdingImageURL&quot;:&quot;https:\\/\\/ichef.bbci.co.uk\\/images\\/ic\\/$recipe\\/p06g29nh.jpg&quot;,&quot;guidance&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;embedRights&quot;:&quot;allowed&quot;,&quot;summary&quot;:&quot;Living in limbo: Assam's four million unwanted&quot;,&quot;liveRewind&quot;:false,&quot;simulcast&quot;:false,&quot;items&quot;:[{&quot;vpid&quot;:&quot;p06g284l&quot;,&quot;live&quot;:false,&quot;duration&quot;:150,&quot;kind&quot;:&quot;programme&quot;}]}},&quot;otherSettings&quot;:{&quot;advertisingAllowed&quot;:true,&quot;continuousPlayCfg&quot;:{&quot;enabled&quot;:false},&quot;isAutoplayOnForAudience&quot;:false}}\"></figure>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div> <figcaption class=\"media-with-caption__caption\"><span class=\"off-screen\">Media caption</span>Living in limbo: Assam's unwanted</figcaption>\n</figure><p>Mohammed Yunus (his name has been changed on his request) says he has visited his father in the Silchar camp every week since he was sent there a year ago. </p><p>\"Despite having the right to vote and owning a small piece of land, we are forced to prove our citizenship in court,\" he says. </p><p>Some people have been declared foreigners due to bureaucratic errors - such as Suchandra Goswami, a part-time music instructor.</p><p>She received a legal notice in 2011 to prove her citizenship.

This would boost present numbers by around a third, although it would leave the American presence far short of its peak of 100,000 in 2010-11.  </p><p>But Mr Trump's speech also included two important new elements. He launched a blistering attack on Pakistan, publicly articulating what his predecessors only said in private. </p><p>\"We have been paying Pakistan billions and billions of dollars at the same time they are housing the very terrorists that we are fighting,\" declared the president. \"It is time for Pakistan to demonstrate its commitment to civilisation, order, and to peace\". </p><p>This was followed by more threats from Secretary of State Rex Tillerson and the National Security Council spokesman. And if this were not bad enough for Pakistan, Mr Trump then applauded India's \"important contributions to stability in Afghanistan\", urging New Delhi to play a larger role. </p><div aria-hidden=\"true\" class=\"bbccom_slot mpu-ad\" id=\"bbccom_mpu_1_2_3\">\n<div class=\"bbccom_advert\">\n<script type=\"text/javascript\">\n            /**/\n            (function() {\n                if (window.bbcdotcom && bbcdotcom.adverts && bbcdotcom.adverts.slotAsync) {\n                    bbcdotcom.adverts.slotAsync('mpu', [1,2,3]);\n                }\n            })();\n            /**/\n        </script>\n</div>\n</div><figure class=\"media-landscape no-caption full-width\">\n<span class=\"image-and-copyright-container\">\n<div class=\"js-delayed-image-load\" data-alt=\"Graph showing the number of US troops in Afghanistan since 2001.\" data-height=\"495\" data-src=\"https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/320/cpsprodpb/15D54/production/_97482498_ustroopsafghanovertime.png\" data-width=\"624\"></div>\n</span>\n</figure><p>Since the beginning of the war, Pakistan has allowed the use of its territory to supply international troops in landlocked Afghanistan, tacitly accepted American drones over its airspace, and co-operated with Western intelligence agencies against some terrorist groups like Al Qaeda. </p><p>However, Pakistan's intelligence agency, the ISI, has also given shelter and support to Afghan insurgents from the 1970s <a class=\"story-body__link\" href=\"http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-asia-35719031\">to the present,</a> including the especially virulent Haqqani network. Its aim has been to limit India's influence - but is also influenced by its disagreements with Kabul. </p><p>Ever since partition, Afghan governments of all stripes have rejected the border known as the Durand Line, laying claim to some Pashtun areas inside Pakistan.  </p><figure class=\"media-landscape no-caption full-width\">\n<span class=\"image-and-copyright-container\">\n<div class=\"js-delayed-image-load\" data-alt=\"Graph showing the areas under Taliban control in Afghanistan.\" data-height=\"500\" data-src=\"https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/320/cpsprodpb/169C4/production/_97521629_afmap.jpg\" data-width=\"624\"></div>\n</span>\n</figure><p>There are three big questions around Trump's approach to Pakistan. </p><p>The first is whether his words will translate into action. After all, we've been here before. \"We need to make clear to people that the cancer is in Pakistan\", President Barack Obama told advisers in 2009, sending his CIA chief and national security adviser to Islamabad to deliver the message.  </p><p>\"You can't keep snakes in your backyard and expect them only to bite your neighbours\", warned then Secretary of State<a class=\"story-body__link\" href=\"http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-south-asia-15388051\"> Hilary Clinton in 2011.</a> The same year, America's top military officer publicly declared that the Haqqani network was \"a veritable arm\" of Pakistani intelligence. </p><p>However, these warnings did not translate into action. Pakistan continued to receive around $1bn per year in so-called Coalition Support Funds, as well as other hundreds of millions of dollars in aid. </p><p>The Trump administration has threatened a range of punishments, including sanctions on Pakistani officials. But will they follow through? This is what Pakistani officials will hope to establish in the coming weeks. </p><figure class=\"media-landscape has-caption full-width\">\n<span class=\"image-and-copyright-container\">\n<div class=\"js-delayed-image-load\" data-alt=\"Hilary Clinton shakes hands with US troops on a visit to Afghanistan in 2011.\" data-height=\"549\" data-src=\"https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/320/cpsprodpb/834C/production/_97521633_gettyimages-129718124.jpg\" data-width=\"976\"></div>\n<span class=\"off-screen\">Image copyright</span>\n<span class=\"story-image-copyright\">AFP</span>\n</span>\n<figcaption class=\"media-caption\">\n<span class=\"off-screen\">Image caption</span>\n<span class=\"media-caption__text\">\n                    Hilary Clinton, pictured here on a visit to Afghanistan in 2011, warned Pakistan about \"snakes in your backyard\"\n                </span>\n</figcaption>\n</figure><p>The second question is how Pakistan will respond. In past crises, Pakistan has blocked Nato supply routes into Afghanistan, such as the Khyber Pass. There are alternative routes via Iran and Russia-dominated Central Asia, but the Trump administration's relations with Tehran and Moscow are even worse. </p><p>Beyond this, Pakistan could also shoot American drones out of the sky, ramp up its support for the Taliban, or halt intelligence co-operation entirely. Of course, Pakistan would have to consider the consequences, from losing out on IMF bailouts to provoking open US air strikes.</p><h2 class=\"story-body__crosshead\">Increasingly confident</h2><p>The third question is whether Pakistan can be coerced into abandoning a policy that has taken shape over 40 years. </p><p>Both Mr Trump and Mr Tillerson declared their openness to peace talks between the Afghan government and the Taliban. Pakistan's concern is that if such talks result in its Taliban allies sharing power in Afghanistan, this would reduce the Taliban's dependence on Pakistan. </p><p>Taliban leaders who have explored peace talks independently of their Pakistani patrons have <a class=\"story-body__link\" href=\"http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-asia-20582286\">ended up arrested </a>or dead. It is possible that Pakistan will decide that it's worth maintaining influence over the Taliban, whatever the cost. </p><p>Domestically, Pakistan has continued supporting militants despite the death of 20,000 civilians in terrorist attacks over the past 15 years. </p><p>It's also notable that a meeting of Pakistani military and political leaders on Thursday concluded that the foreign minister should immediately set off on a tour of \"friendly states\", beginning with China. </p><p>Pakistan is increasingly confident in the support of Beijing, which is investing tens of billions of dollars in the country as part of the ambitious China-Pakistan Economic Corridor (CPEC). However, it's not entirely clear how far China is willing to go to bail out Pakistan, financially or politically.</p><figure class=\"media-landscape has-caption full-width\">\n<span class=\"image-and-copyright-container\">\n<div class=\"js-delayed-image-load\" data-alt=\"Image shows the aftermath of the 2008 suicide bomb attack on the Indian Embassy in Kabul\" data-height=\"549\" data-src=\"https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/320/cpsprodpb/11F8C/production/_97521637_005841197.jpg\" data-width=\"976\"></div>\n<span class=\"off-screen\">Image copyright</span>\n<span class=\"story-image-copyright\">AFP</span>\n</span>\n<figcaption class=\"media-caption\">\n<span class=\"off-screen\">Image caption</span>\n<span class=\"media-caption__text\">\n                    The aftermath of the 2008 suicide bomb attack on the Indian Embassy in Kabul\n                </span>\n</figcaption>\n</figure><p>Finally, what should we make of Trump's effort to enlist Indian support? Some critics have argued that this is likely to provoke Pakistan into expanding its support for the Taliban. </p><p>However, we should bear in mind that the US tried to restrict India's role in Afghanistan through the 2000s, with no positive change in Pakistan's behaviour. Instead, Pakistan is believed to have sponsored the bombing of the Indian embassy in Kabul in 2008, though Islamabad denies this.</p><p>India expanded its security role in Afghanistan from 2011 onwards, when it signed a <a class=\"story-body__link\" href=\"http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-south-asia-15161776\">strategic partnership</a> with Kabul. It expanded its training of Afghan military officers, 4,000 so far, and gave second-hand attack helicopters to the struggling Afghan National Security Forces (ANSF). This, too, had no apparent impact on Pakistan's policy. </p><p>We should be realistic about India's potential role. Delhi does not have the capacity to do too much more. It requires co-operation with its old partners Russia or Iran to send military supplies, but both those countries have expanded their own ties with parts of the Taliban in recent years. </p><p>We should also note that President Trump emphasised India's role in the specific areas of \"economic assistance and development\". </p><p>This assistance, to the tune of $2bn (£1.56bn), has contributed to India's popularity amongst Afghans. Delhi would not want military support to put that soft power at risk. </p><p>But on balance, as Western countries focus on terrorist threats from the Middle East and North Africa, and grow more weary of the longest war in their modern history, India's support to a weak Afghan state and its army should probably be welcomed. </p><p><i>Update 25 August 2017: The text referring to the bombing of the Indian embassy in Kabul in 2008 has been updated to include Islamabad's denial of involvement.</i></p>\n</div>"
