            "title": "Why Australia's PM is 'keeping enemies close' in government reboot",
            "content": "Party infighting was behind Malcolm Turnbull's removal as Australia's prime minister last week. The BBC's Hywel Griffith looks at how some of the key players have fared. After the drama of \"the spill\", new Prime Minister Scott Morrison cast himself as a next-generation leader, anxious to end the plotting of the past. But his newly assembled cast of frontbenchers includes several protagonists from last week's chaos in leading roles.The first to be sworn in was Peter Dutton, the man who initiated the downfall of Malcolm Turnbull, who has returned as Home Affairs Minister.One of Mr Dutton's key supporters was Angus Taylor, who has landed the key position of Energy Minister. Now former prime minister Tony Abbott, who many accuse of orchestrating last week's events from the wings, has been brought back into the limelight as the government's likely indigenous affairs envoy. According to Dr Stewart Jackson, from the University of Sydney, it could be a smart move by Mr Morrison.Rather than rewarding \"insurgency\" (as Mr Turnbull put it), Dr Jackson argues that giving Mr Abbott a new role in government - but outside of the cabinet - is a way of keeping him busy. \"And it means you can send him off to the Northern Territory often, and the Northern Territory is far away [from Canberra],\" Dr Jackson says.Mr Abbott's part in last week's calamitous episode has drawn wide criticism. Several Liberal Party members have publicly condemned Mr Abbott, while former Labor prime minister Kevin Rudd described him as a \"giant wrecking ball of Australian politics\".For his part, Mr Abbott has asserted \"the era of the political assassin is over,\" without making it fully clear whether he saw himself as the assassin or the victim. Mr Abbott was himself ousted by Mr Turnbull in 2015.But as he discussed Mr Morrison's job offer, Mr Abbott told 2GB radio that \"we've had far too much backstabbing, we've had far too much leaking and briefing, and I think we can put all of that behind us\".Similar motives may have been at play in offering a new drought envoy role to former deputy PM Barnaby Joyce, who had his own spectacular falling out with Mr Turnbull.Dr Jackson says: \"I did think initially, is this way of saying [to Mr Abbott] 'Go out there into the bush, along with Barnaby, and spend all your time out there so you won't be here making trouble?'\"But, in fact, Dr Jackson believes that Mr Morrison is hoping to harness both men's prominent media profiles in order to sell the government's message.\"Tony Abbott's capacity for being able to get on to the media is renowned and I don't think this is going to stop him doing that,\" he argues.\"But at least it will refocus people's attention, and ask what are you doing on indigenous affairs - a tricky portfolio at the best of times.\"Although Mr Dutton was his direct rival in the leadership contest, Mr Morrison decided very quickly not to banish him to the backbenches, either. By returning Mr Dutton to his old job, he is perhaps keeping his friends close, and his enemies closer. Mr Turnbull has already announced that he will quit parliament.With nine months at most before the next election, the government desperately needs to show the voters a united front. And according to Dr Jackson, the prime minister has at least given himself \"a reasonable chance of salvaging something\".",

The exploitation of the Amazon rainforest, much of which is in Brazil, has been a major international worry, since the wilderness is a vital regulator of the climate.

A veteran of the centrist Brazilian Democratic Movement Party (PMDB), Mr Temer will serve out the rest of Ms Rousseff's term to the end of 2018.Once political allies, Mr Temer served as vice-president in Ms Rousseff's government for over five years before playing a key role in impeachment proceedings against her. He acted as interim president during her trial.In his first televised cabinet meeting following his inauguration, Mr Temer pledged to bring back \"political stability\" to the recession-stricken country.\"My only interest is in handing over to my successor a country that is reconciled, pacified and growing economically,\" the former law professor said.Descriptions of his public persona have ranged from \"a good negotiator\" to \"conspirator\", and Mr Temer has himself been implicated in corruption scandals.

            "content": "Kevin Hart has split opinion as a \"zero tolerance\" mobile phone ban at his UK gigs left some people out of pocket.Fans were left frustrated with the US comedian's strict policy as some claimed they were removed from the venue for as little as sending a text.But others saw the funny side as they reported sightings of so-called \"cell phone security\" around the O2 Arena on Sunday.And one person keen to share a snap of their experience on social media was forced to resort to more primitive means.Went to see Kevin Hart at The O2. There was a very aggressive 'don't even touch your phone' rule so I drew the gig. pic.twitter.com/1oyND3DM9LEnd of Twitter post  by @brucedaisleyIt is not the first time phones have been banned at gigs - but it might be the dawning of a new age of enforcement.Chris Rock fans will recall a similar ban as they were forced to keep their mobile phones in a locked pouch while at his shows last year.But Hart's ban does not include any such technology - instead relying on so-called \"cell phone security\" to police the venue and enforce the rule.Cell phones security in the O2, Kevin Hart is not about to let any footage slip online 😂 pic.twitter.com/KFDKcuI6KlEnd of Twitter post  by @lorenzoofficialFans were warned in advance of the ban, which has applied to Hart's entire UK tour.O2 advised attendees that \"anyone caught using a phone or camera before or during the show will be ejected with no refund\", with the other tour venues issuing similar warnings.And one fan shared a picture of a leaflet apparently handed out at the show reinforcing the rules.Cell Phone security is tight at @KevinHart4real ... fuming if you get kicked out for talking 🙈😂 pic.twitter.com/7ZgSe3OoiKEnd of Twitter post  by @KingSMJ23Some fans did not expect the rules to be so strictly enforced, as one person reported being removed from a show for sending \"a five word text\" to her mother.Vibe Tickets founder Luke Massie called the decision \"ridiculous\" and said that fans \"should be entitled\" to use mobile phones during a gig.This is ridiculous @KevinHart4real, fans pay good money to attend live events. They should be entitled to use their phones. Capture the moment and re live the memory as and when they like. I hope this fan is contacted and given the opportunity to see you again.End of Twitter post  by @LukeMassieOthers were less understanding and pointed out that it was repeatedly stated that phones were prohibited inside the auditoriumOne person joked that there were \"about 500 warnings\" to put away mobiles, while another said that he \"loved\" the blanket ban on phones.And Twitter user Luke Robinson was so enamoured with the experience that he urged other comedians to follow the same rule.Kevin Hart banned mobile phones etc from the performance, and it actually makes the experience much better, more acts should do that 🤷🏾‍♂️End of Twitter post  by @BambiMusicMeanwhile, the \"cell phone police\" were not able to spot everyone that broke the rules, with one pair \"living life dangerously\" by taking a risky snap at the show.But this was not a risk that unofficial Kevin Hart artist Bruce Daisley was willing to take, as he produced an analogue \"selfie\" of his trip to the show.Did I get a selfie of my time? Yes. No thanks to the camera ban. pic.twitter.com/AYN7gBAqmYEnd of Twitter post 2 by @brucedaisley",

            "title": "High-speed chase that sparked migrant tragedy",
            "content": "End of Youtube post  by BBC NewsIn Romania's western city of Timisoara, Romanians, Hungarians and Germans have lived side-by-side for centuries. Together, they began the revolution in 1989 which overthrew the communist dictatorship of Nicolae Ceausescu.Today, Timisoara welcomes, or at least tolerates, its new arrivals: thousands of Afghans, Pakistanis, Kurds and Syrians on their way to Western Europe.Some fall in love with the kindness they encounter and end up staying in Timisoara. But most place their lives in the hands of smugglers to reach the West.In October last year, 18 people set out on that journey.It cost the lives of both the smuggler and the young mother of twin girls, and left scars on many of the others.The group set out with a local smuggler guide on 1 October 2017, hoping to cross the border into Hungary on their way to Germany or Italy.Some of them knew each other from Kurdistan. Others met in Timisoara or in the dark, whispering woods and followed each other over the border. For two nights they walked, resting during the day in fields of tall maize. \"It was so cold,\" Aidi told me.\"The women and children suffered the most,\" said Safaa. On the third night, just before 02:00, a Tunisian smuggler in a black minivan with Italian plates picked them up. He hurried them inside and set off for the border. \"I think the Hungarian police were already watching us,\" Murat told me. \"They came after us so quickly.\"When the smuggler saw flashing blue lights in his mirror he shouted at his passengers to get down - and he put his foot on the accelerator. The van smashed into a police roadblock, then hurtled down a motorway embankment. Baran, the mother of nine-year-old twins Hashem and Pasha, died on the spot. The driver died later that day.Hospitals in Szeged and Oroshaza treated the 17 survivors. Hali was in the worst condition. She had a cracked skull, broken ribs, broken arms and legs, and cracked pelvic bones. When I first met her three months after the crash she could sit up in bed, but hardly speak. Her son Safaa, 21, spent all day at her bedside. His father in Iraq and one of his brothers in Germany paid for all the medical expenses, as well as Safaa's cheap accommodation near the hospital. By now the bill was already $10,000 (£7,700), and the family's funds had dried up. Safaa, like all the survivors, praised the excellent medical care given to them. Although the Hungarian government has passed laws criminalising migrants and those who give them aid, the doctors have treated them like victims. Aidi, 20, praised Dr Zoltan, the surgeon who fixed her broken legs when she feared she would never walk again.And a local Baptist pastor, Noemi Nikodem, befriended her in the hospital and became like a sister to her. Hungarian police were less friendly.They were a constant presence in the wards, pressuring doctors to sign papers as soon as the patients were deemed fit enough to face deportation back to Romania. All were sent back to Timisoara except for the orphaned children: Hashem and Pasha, the nine year-old twins; Horia, a 12-year-old girl travelling alone; Hali because she was too badly injured and Hali's children Safaa and Sonia. It was not the end of the journey for the rest.Still barely able to walk, Akhir stowed away in a lorry in late November. He reached Germany after a 37-hour journey and has applied for asylum. Murat, Khose and 10-year-old Aiman reached Hanover in May. But that was after spending two months in detention in the Czech Republic, when their hiding place in another lorry was discovered. Aidi hid under a blanket in a car that crossed the Romanian border into Hungary at night. In Timisoara, the rumour is that the smuggler gets $2,000 and the border guards $1,000 for each illicit passenger - something Hungarian police deny. \"The Hungarian police pay special attention to the prevention and detection of corruption, and act swiftly against any officer who breaks the law,\" the police told the BBC.Aidi, now in a temporary home in the German town of Regensburg, told me: \"I was so afraid that the police would find me. Or that the car would have an accident again.\" But she sailed through unscathed, and has now been reunited with her parents and granted asylum.Samir made it to Italy in the back of a truck in April. The twins, Hashem and Pasha, were adopted by relatives in Germany.Horia was taken in by an aunt in Vienna, and could finally leave the children's home where they were placed near Budapest in March.Thanks to the mediation of the UN refugee agency UNHCR, Safaa and Hali have been placed in Hungary's last open refugee camp while German authorities consider their request for family reunification.All the others, contacted by the BBC, confirmed that they had reached Germany. One, Omar, was deported from Germany back to Romania after his asylum request failed. Nine months after the fatal crash, 14 of the 17 survivors have made it to their chosen destinations in Western Europe, though still scarred by the accident. Despite the chorus of politicians pronouncing the Balkan migrant route closed, it is still open - but just a crack.",

There was a lot of gunfire at our gate... when I came out, I saw many people injured on the ground and others dead,\" she told Reuters.Somalia has faced instability and violence since 1991, when the military government was overthrown.The ousting of Mohamed Siad Barre led to a decades-long civil war between rival warlords, and two northern regions - Somaliland and Puntland - effectively broke away from Somalia.Much of the country has effectively been a war zone.A UN-backed unity government was formed in 2012. Al-Shabab has since been driven out of many urban areas but still controls territory in rural regions and carries out gun attacks and bombings on military and civilian targets.The militant group has imposed a strict version of Sharia in areas under its control, including stoning to death women accused of adultery and amputating the hands of thieves.A truck attack in Mogadishu in October last year killed at least 500 people in the deadliest bombing in Somalia.A man accused of leading an al-Shabab unit that carried out the attack was sentenced to death in February.",

            "content": "The Saudi-led coalition in Yemen has expressed regret over \"mistakes\" made in a deadly air strike on a bus.More than 40 children were killed in the strike in a market in northern Saada province on 9 August, drawing international condemnation.In a statement on Saturday, the coalition pledged to hold those responsible for the strike accountable.But a spokesman for the coalition's own investigation maintained that the strike had targeted a Houthi leader.The head of the coalition's Joint Incidents Assessment Team (JIAT), Lt Gen Mansour al-Mansour, said its investigation had found that the bus was carrying Houthi leaders and fighters and was therefore a \"legitimate\" military target, but admitted that the location of the strike had led to collateral damage.A statement carried by the Saudi state news agency SPA on Saturday said: \"The Joint Forces Command of the Coalition expresses regret over the mistakes, extends its sympathies, condolences and solidarity to the families of the victims.\"The coalition said it would co-ordinate with the Yemeni government to compensate families of victims and would also review its rules of engagement.The coalition insists it never deliberately targets civilians, but human rights groups have accused it of bombing markets, schools, hospitals and residential areas.Earlier this week, the coalition rejected the findings of a UN report which said that war crimes may have been committed by all parties in the conflict.UN experts accused Yemeni government forces, the coalition backing them, and the rebel Houthi movement of making little effort to minimise civilian casualties.Last week, another strike to the south of the port city of Hudaydah killed at least 22 children and four women.Yemen has been devastated by a conflict that escalated in early 2015, when the Houthis seized control of much of the west of the country and forced President Abdrabbuh Mansour Hadi to flee abroad.Alarmed by the rise of a group they saw as an Iranian proxy, the UAE, Saudi Arabia and seven other Arab states intervened in an attempt to restore the government.Almost 10,000 people - two-thirds of them civilians - have been killed and 55,000 others injured in the fighting, according to the United Nations.The fighting and a partial blockade by the coalition has also left 22 million people in need of humanitarian aid, created the world's largest food security emergency, and led to a cholera outbreak that is thought to have affected a million people.",

            "title": "Palestinians brand US aid cut to UN group 'a flagrant assault'",
            "content": "Palestinian officials have condemned the US decision to end all funding to the UN's Palestinian refugee agency.The US has been the largest donor to the United Nations Relief and Works Agency (Unrwa) - but now says the organisation is \"irredeemably flawed\".Palestinian President Mahmoud Abbas's spokesman has called the move a \"flagrant assault against the Palestinian people\".However, an Israeli official told AFP: \"Israel supports the US move\".Unrwa says it currently supports more than five million Palestinians in Gaza, the West Bank, Jordan, Syria and Lebanon, including providing health care, education and social services.The US has been the largest single donor to Unrwa, providing $368m (£284m) in 2016 and funding almost 30% of its operations in the region.But in January, the administration of President Donald Trump withheld more than half of its planned funding to Unrwa, saying it would keep back $65m unless the body carried out \"reforms\". On Friday, the US state department said in a statement that \"the US will no longer commit further funding to this irredeemably flawed operation\".The state department said the US had shouldered a \"very disproportionate share of the burden of Unrwa's costs\", and that the international community should contribute more.It has also said it is unhappy that Unrwa has kept expanding the number of people eligible for assistance, and says its business model is \"simply unsustainable and has been in crisis mode for many years\".This links to a wider disagreement over which Palestinians are refugees with a right to return to the homes they fled following the 1948 Arab-Israeli war.The UN says there are about five million Palestinian refugees, including the descendants of people who fled the 1948 war.However, the US and Israel disagree with how this number is calculated, and say the number of Palestinian refugees should be much smaller.President Trump also appears unhappy with how US aid to the region has been received.He has previously tweeted that the US has not received \"appreciation or respect\" for the aid it has provided, and that the Palestinians are unwilling to negotiate with Israel. US ambassador to the UN, Nikki Haley, said earlier this week: \"There's an endless number of refugees that continue to get assistance, but more importantly, the Palestinians continue to bash America.\"The state department says it remains \"deeply concerned regarding the impact upon innocent Palestinians, especially school children, of the failure of Unrwa\".The organisation's chief spokesperson, Chris Gunness, told the BBC the impact of the US move would be devastating.\"It's likely to be widespread, profound, dramatic and unpredictable because, let's make no mistake, some of the most marginalised and fragile and vulnerable communities in the Middle East are going to likely suffer because of this.\"Mr Gunness says 526,000 schoolchildren receive a Unrwa education every day, while it also assists \"1.7 million food insecure people\". \"We do assistance to disabled refugees, to women, to vulnerable children. The list goes on and, as I say, the impact on them is likely to be utterly devastating.\"Germany's foreign ministry has said it will increase contributions to Unrwa to try to maintain stability.Palestinian officials have condemned the US move. A spokesman for President Abbas told Reuters the decision was in \"defiance of UN resolutions\", and would not change the fact that the US \"no longer has a role in the region\" and \"is not a part of the solution\".The Palestinian Liberation Organization said a statement that the cut was \"a cruel and irresponsible move targeting the most vulnerable segment of Palestinian society\". The Palestinian militant group Hamas told Reuters that the move was a \"grave escalation against the Palestinian people\".Palestinian officials have already accused the US of pro-Israel bias, especially after Mr Trump recognised Jerusalem as Israel's capital and opened a US embassy in Jerusalem, despite the city being claimed by both sides.The move overturned decades of US neutrality on the issue and attracted international criticism.Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu has previously called for Unrwa's funding to be cut gradually and its responsibilities transferred to the UN's global refugee agency, the UNHCR, arguing that it \"perpetuates the Palestinian problem\".On Saturday, an official in Mr Netanyahu's office told AFP that \"Israel supports the US move\", adding: \"Consolidating the refugee status of Palestinians is one of the problems that perpetuates the conflict.\"However, some Israelis have previously raised concerns that weakening Unrwa could cause regional instability and create more extremism in the region.",

            "content": "China has blocked access to the website of Australia's national broadcaster, the Australian Broadcasting Corp (ABC).The ABC said users in China were \"abruptly\" blocked from visiting its site and apps two weeks ago.Chinese regulators told the ABC the site had breached the country's laws, but did not specify any violations.China operates a strict internet censorship regime and often blocks access to foreign sites if they publish content it does not want people to see. The BBC News and the New York Times websites are also unavailable in China at present.The ABC's China-based journalists said they had confirmed the site had been blocked, after making several enquiries about its status. \"The ABC's website and apps are usually accessible to Chinese web users and are not subject to the 'Great Firewall' of censorship, but access was abruptly stopped on August 22,\" journalists Bill Birtles and Matthew Carney wrote.The broadcaster said it had not been able to confirm the reason for the ban.An official at the Office of the Central Cyberspace Affairs Commission told the journalists: \"China's internet is fully open. We welcome internet enterprises from all over the world to provide good information to the netizens of China.\"However, state cyber sovereignty rights shall be maintained towards some overseas websites violating China's laws and regulations, spreading rumours, pornographic information, gambling, violent terrorism and some other illegal harmful information which will endanger state security and damage national pride.\"Prime Minister Scott Morrison said the ban was an issue for China.\"China's a sovereign country, they make decisions about what happens there, we make decisions about what happens here,\" he told radio station 3AW.The ABC launched a Chinese-language version of its news site last year.The latest move comes amid a period of diplomatic tensions between the two nations over reports of China's alleged interference in Australian politics and society. This had led to Canberra enacting new laws aimed at preventing foreign interference.Last year, China's embassy in Canberra heavily criticised Australia media reports, including an investigation from the ABC and Fairfax Media, about Beijing's influence in Australia. \"Those reports, which were made up out of thin air and filled with Cold War mentality and ideological bias, reflected a typical anti-China hysteria and paranoi[a],\" the embassy said.Last month, Canberra also effectively barred Chinese telecommunications firm Huawei from competing for its 5G network, after it extended national security regulations on the infrastructure project.",

            "title": "Obituary: John McCain",
            "content": "John McCain was the Vietnam war hero who became one of America's most high-profile politicians.His brand of common-sense conservatism often saw him clash with his Republican allies and he was a fierce critic of the presidency of Donald Trump.He gained a reputation for being a dealmaker, someone who was prepared to compromise to get the job done.But he failed to win the 2008 presidential election, facing criticism from some quarters for his choice of Alaska governor Sarah Palin as his running mate.John Sidney McCain III was born on 29 Aug 1936 at Coco Solo Naval Air Station in the Panama Canal Zone, an area then under US control. Naval service was in his blood, both his father and grandfather ending their naval careers as four star admirals.His father's various postings saw the young McCain attending a host of different schools before he enrolled in the United States Naval Academy at Annapolis, Maryland.There he established a reputation for leadership, coupled with a fine disdain for authority. The latter trait, along with his propensity to do just enough to achieve grades in subjects he found boring, saw him graduate in 1958 near the bottom of his class. He moved on to Pensacola in Florida, dubbed the cradle of naval aviation where, after a two-and-a-half year course, he left with his pilot's qualifications and a reputation as a party animal.He wasn't the most competent of flyers. While still under training he crashed a plane into the sea, leading him to be dubbed \"cocky, occasionally cavalier and prone to testing limits\".\"John was what they call a push-the-envelope guy,\" was the verdict of one of the pilots who flew with him.After being assigned to fly Skyraider aircraft from a US carrier in the Mediterranean he flew his plane into electrical wires in Spain, causing a power failure in the surrounding area.In 1967 he was transferred to the US carrier Forrestal which was engaged in the operation dubbed \"Rolling Thunder\" - the sustained bombing of North Vietnam. Following a fire on the Forrestal, in which he was injured, he transferred to the USS Oriskany.On 26 Oct 1967 he was shot down while flying a mission over Hanoi. Badly injured - having fractured both arms and a leg when he ejected - he was captured by North Vietnamese troops.He was refused all but the most rudimentary medical care, and interrogated under torture. The beatings only stopped when the North Vietnamese discovered he was the son of an admiral. In March 1968, he was placed in solitary confinement where he remained for two years.When his father became commander of US forces in Vietnam, his captors - sensing a propaganda opportunity - offered to release him. McCain refused unless every US prisoner captured before him was released first.His captors restarted the brutal torture regime to the extent that McCain, beaten and suffering from dysentery, attempted suicide. He was eventually released after five and half years in captivity, but with lasting injuries.He returned to find his wife Carol, whom he had married in 1965, had been badly injured in a car accident which had left her disfigured.A spell at the Navy's liaison office to the US Senate in 1977 kindled an interest in politics. He also began dating a teacher, Cindy Lou Hensley, whom he married in 1980 after his first wife had granted him a divorce. In 1981 he quit the Navy and set out to run for Congress, winning a seat in Phoenix, Arizona, where his new father-in-law ran a beer distribution company.He was a strong supporter of the then-president, Ronald Reagan, including favouring a hard line against the Soviet Union and the backing of the Contras in Nicaragua. Re-elected to Congress with an overwhelming majority in 1984, he was asked to serve on the influential House Foreign Affairs Committee, which further raised his profile.In 1987, he entered the Senate to represent Arizona, replacing the arch-conservative Barry Goldwater who had retired. His expertise in the Navy led to a seat on the Senate Armed Forces Committee. He also served on the Indian Affairs Committee where, as a keen gambler himself, he pushed through new laws that allowed native Americans to generate revenue from casinos.McCain had already established a reputation of not being afraid to challenge his own party leadership. He caused a stir when he twice supported President Clinton's nominees for the Supreme Court, judging them to be the best people for the job.In the early 90s, the new senator was involved in a corruption scandal after he and four Democratic senators were accused of trying to intimidate regulators on behalf of a campaign donor who eventually served prison time for corrupt management practices. He received a mild warning after an investigation found he \"exercised poor judgment in intervening with the regulators\" but that his actions \"were not improper\". McCain announced he was running for the Republican nomination for president in September 1999.He pitched himself as the anti-establishment candidate against fellow candidate, Texas Governor George W Bush, who could rely on most of the support - and the money - from the party hierarchy. In what became a bitter campaign, Bush proved adept at harnessing the support of the Christian right and McCain, after a heavy defeat on so-called Super Tuesday, quit the race in March 2000.While he pledged his support for Bush, McCain characteristically showed he was not afraid to criticise the new president. He was one of only two Republican senators to vote against tax cuts and also opposed the president's policies on gun control. However, after the 9/11 attacks he supported Bush's war in Afghanistan and the invasion of Iraq, although as the latter operation dragged on, he began to question the Bush strategy and the policies of the US defence secretary, Donald Rumsfeld.In April 2007, McCain announced he would again run for president and fought off a strong challenge from New York mayor Rudy Giuliani and the Massachusetts governor Mitt Romney for the Republican nomination. Mindful of his need to attract support from conservative Christians, he surprised everyone by announcing virtually unknown Sarah Palin, the governor of Alaska, as his running mate.But while Palin's hockey mum persona was welcomed by the right, mainstream voters began to question her lack of experience and a series of poor performances in TV interviews cast doubts on the credibility of the Republican campaign.Outspent by the Obama campaign, and carrying the legacy of eight years of a Bush presidency, McCain lost both the electoral college and the popular vote and Obama entered the White House.Unusually, the relationship between the two men seemed to blossom after the election and Obama often consulted McCain. However, the senator came out strongly in opposition to the new president's plans to stimulate the economy, claiming it was money spent to no useful purpose.Back in Arizona, he fought off a challenge by a Tea Party candidate and easily retained his Senate seat in the 2010 elections. His profile in the Senate remained high and his regular appearances on US TV maintained his position as one of the best known politicians in the US.When Republicans began selecting their presidential candidate for the 2016 election, McCain expressed grave doubts over Donald Trump's suitability for the job, once referring to a roomful of Trump supporters as \"crazies\".The relationship between the two men took a further knock when Trump criticised McCain's war record.\"He's not a war hero,\" Trump opined. \"He's a war hero because he was captured? I like people who weren't captured.\"McCain withdrew his support for Trump in October 2016, the day after a 2005 recording emerged of Trump making obscene remarks about women and appearing to admit to sexual assault.\"When Mr Trump attacks women and demeans the women in our nation and in our society, that is a point where I just have to part company,\" he said.However, Trump, along with Barack Obama, was among the first to offer good wishes to McCain when, in July 2017, it was announced that he was suffering with a brain tumour.The same month - while sporting a scar over his left eye after surgery for a blood clot - he dramatically used a \"thumbs down\" to vote against a Republican health care repeal bill. The president tweeted that McCain, and other senators who voted against the bill, had \"let the American people down\".John McCain's determination to plot his own political course, regardless of the party line, probably explains why he never reached the highest office in US politics. But he was seen as a man of principle, someone happy to sit down with his political opponents if there was a compromise to be reached. \"I will work with anyone to get this country moving again,\" he once said. \"I will listen to any idea that is offered in good faith and intended to help solve our problems.\"",

            "content": "According to United Nations figures, 2.3 million people left Venezuela between 2014 and up to June 2018. Thousands continue to flee.With 7% of the population having left nearly every family has been affected. Development charity Cafod, which forms part of Caritas International, has spoken to some of those left behind. A retired seamstress and mother of nine, María Teresa Jiménez has watched five of her children and nine of her grandchildren leave Venezuela.\"I worked for 38 years as a seamstress, and it went very well, my children wanted for nothing. Now, we don't even have money for medicine,\" she says of the shortages which have hit Venezuela for the past years. \"Fortunately, I didn't have my children now, I had them at a time when they could succeed. \"I'm happy that my children are in a place where they don't face danger. I wish I were 20 years younger, so I could go with them.\"Magaly Henríquez is a mother of five. She has stayed behind while her two youngest children, María Eugenia, a special education teacher, and Junior, a businessman, have immigrated.  \"It is really painful,\" says Ms Henríquez. \"My son had so many dreams. He started a paint supply business (which was forced to close due to rising prices). My daughter was working two jobs, and that wasn't enough for her to survive here. Many of the teachers in Venezuela had to leave.\"Junior has now found work in Peru as a physical trainer and María Eugenia works as a housekeeper.\"I grew up in a free Venezuela,\" says Ms Henríquez \"We didn't have these limitations with money. We could afford things. We had what we needed to live.\"Ms Pérez has been caring for her grandchildren Naile, 12, Naiberli, 7 and Naire, 13, for a month, after her daughter went to seek work in Colombia. \"She'd been looking for work for over two years and nothing. I told her to take advantage of the fact I still have the strength to look after them,\" says Ms Pérez.\"It's hard on the girls. They've had birthdays, graduations and their mum isn't there. But when she calls they just tell her not to worry that they are fine and love her very much.\" School enrolment is fast approaching, and registration requires that each child submits ID photos. The photographs cost a little more than a quarter of the average monthly salary.If she doesn't get the images taken the girls will not be able to go to school.Fr Cristóbal Domínguez has seen a mass exodus of youth from his parish - in the first half of the year, 17 youth ministry members migrated.\"We suffered the loss of the entire parish choir, which was made up of young adults who migrated last December,\" he says.  \"We're now trying to form a new choir, but the topic of conversation is always about what other countries they can go to, which one offers more opportunities.\"Sadly, many of them feel that to find brighter horizons their only option is to migrate.\"Working alongside Caritas Venezuela, Fr Cristóbal's parish runs an \"olla comunitaria\", a soup kitchen providing food for more than 500 people every week. With the new school year only weeks away, he fears that many classes will be without teachers as they will have migrated.   All photographs by Caritas International.",

            "content": "Brazil's top electoral court has ruled that jailed former President Luiz Inácio Lula da Silva cannot run as a candidate in the presidential election because of his corruption conviction. Judges voted against his running in October's ballot by a majority of six votes to one in the seven-member court. Lula, 72, was leading in polls ahead of the vote despite serving a 12-year jail term for accepting a bribe. His legal team has said they will appeal against the court's decision.Brazil's Workers' Party (PT) later responded to the court's decision in a statement, saying it would \"fight by all means\" for Lula's candidacy.\"We will present all appeals before the courts for the recognition of the rights of Lula provided by law and international treaties ratified by Brazil,\" the statement said, adding: \"We will defend Lula in the streets, with the people.\"Lula's conviction for money laundering and corruption was upheld in January. In Brazil, no one convicted of a crime upheld on appeal can run for office.However, exceptions have been made to the law before.In declaring Lula ineligible to stand on Friday, one judge said: \"What is at stake here today is the equality of all citizens before the law and the Constitution.\"Lula was convicted of receiving a renovated beachfront apartment worth some 3.7m reais ($1.1m; £790,000) as a bribe by engineering firm OAS.He denied wrongdoing and said his conviction was part of a plot to prevent him returning to power.The former president is the most high-profile person convicted in the sweeping Operation Car Wash anti-corruption investigation. Despite his jail sentence, PT voted to nominate Lula as its candidate last month. Lula reportedly chose Fernando Haddad, former mayor of São Paulo, to run for the PT should he be prevented from doing so.Serving as president from 2003 to 2011, Lula presided over a surge in economic growth and major social programmes that left him with an 87% approval rating on leaving office.But the former leader surrendered to police in April after his corruption conviction.An appeal in January not only saw the court uphold his original conviction, but also increase the length of the sentence by two-and-a-half years.Before Friday's court judgement on whether he could run, Brazil's prosecutor general filed to bar his candidacy due to the law prohibiting those who have lost appeals against their conviction from standing.Despite this, recent polls reportedly showed that around one-third of Brazilians would back Lula if he were allowed to run, which would make him the front-runner in October's vote.

            "title": "Why Australia is talking about a French au pair",
            "content": "An Australian minister is facing growing questions over why he personally intervened to grant a visa to a French au pair, in a case that has attracted national attention.Home Affairs Minister Peter Dutton denies he acted improperly in halting the deportation of Alexandra Deuwel.The decision helped a wealthy family, and followed a plea by their relative - a prominent sporting chief executive.Local media said Mr Dutton had overruled a senior official's advice.Critics have compared the case to Mr Dutton's unwavering commitment, as immigration minister, to keeping asylum seekers in overseas detention - a long-time controversial policy.Mr Dutton failed in two attempts to become prime minister last week, ultimately losing out to Scott Morrison.Ms Deuwel, 27, had her tourist visa cancelled on arrival in Australia in 2015, on suspicions that she had intended to work.However, Mr Dutton used his ministerial discretion to reverse the decision. Ms Deuwel had previously worked for pastoralists Callum and Skye MacLachlan in South Australia. Their relative, Australian Football League boss Gillon McLachlan (who uses an alternative spelling), had lobbied Mr Dutton to intervene in Ms Deuwel's case.Adding to public scrutiny, Callum MacLachlan's father, Hugh, has donated about A$150,000 (£84,000; $110,000) to the governing Liberal Party since 1999, local media reported.Mr Dutton's decision to grant a visa to at least one other au pair is already the subject of a Senate inquiry.On Thursday, the minister strongly rejected any suggestion that the MacLachlan family had influenced his decision.He said he had assessed Ms Deuwel's case on its merits, telling radio 2GB that she had no criminal history and had agreed not to work in Australia.\"I thought it was an application of common sense,\" he said.Mr Dutton has not responded to reports that an Australian Border Force official warned him in 2015 that some evidence \"does not support the Minister intervening\".Aside from scrutiny of the case specifically, observers have pointed out that it has only become public now - days after Mr Dutton's failed leadership bids.\"It suggests that somebody behind the scenes is trying to do as much damage as they possibly can to Peter Dutton in circumstances where he's obviously been in the headlines,\" ABC political correspondent Laura Tingle said on Tuesday.But it has also ignited allegations of double-standards on visa issues: among those angered are supporters of a Tamil family involved in a high-profile effort to stay in Australia.The family, who have lived for years in Queensland, are now facing deportation - despite a petition to Mr Dutton that gathered almost 120,000 signatures.Others have made similar comparisons about Australia's policy of sending asylum seekers who arrive by boat to Nauru and Papua New Guinea. The policy has been criticised by human rights groups as inhumane. Recently, it has been reported that child asylum seekers in particular have been struggling acutely with mental illness.#Dutton has steadfastly refused to give 'ministerial approval' to  children on #Nauru desperately in need of critical medical attention but issues a visa to an AU Pair on humanitarian grounds for the benefit of  the rich and powerful.

Dozens of other people are reported to have been wounded.Human Rights Watch condemned the violence and said that at least 18 of the dead were civilians, among them four children.Hundreds of migrants trapped by the fighting have been moved to other detention centres, while the city's airport was closed for two days on Friday.Libya has faced continuing chaos since Nato-backed forces overthrew long-serving ruler Col Muammar Gaddafi in October 2011, with rival political forces in the east and west and powerful armed militias across the country.",

            "content": "If you're looking to post something about John Oliver on Chinese social media this week, chances are you can't.The British television host been censored on China's biggest social media site, just days after he criticised Chinese President Xi Jinping on his popular US show Last Week Tonight.In the show's latest episode, Mr Oliver highlights the political, human rights and economic issues China is currently facing, and delivers some striking criticisms of the Chinese government. Attempts by the BBC to post a status on Weibo - China's biggest social media platform - with the term \"John Oliver\" were blocked. Instead an error message pops up, informing you that the post violates \"relevant laws and regulations\".If you try searching for \"John Oliver\", it does yield some results, though you won't find any new posts - the most recent one is from the 12 June, a week before the \"Last Week Tonight\" episode aired.A search for the show's name in Mandarin also brings up no results.In the 20-minute episode, the host touches on some topics that are known to be controversial in China.He mentions China's removal of presidential term limits, which has essentially allowed President Xi to remain in power for life, adding that Mr Xi has \"gone out of his way to form a cult of personality\".The removal of presidential terms was highly criticised and online censors had then rushed to block discussion around the topic.Mr Oliver also brings up China's treatment of the Uighurs, a Muslim minority who live primarily in the region of Xinjiang and say they have long faced discrimination. The Chinese government blames bloody clashes on Islamist militants and separatists. In recent years China has introduced new restrictions on the Uighur people.The TV host also mentions Liu Xiaobo, one of China's most prominent human rights advocates and a Nobel peace prize laureate.Mr Liu, who died in 2017 at the age of 61, had been serving an 11-year prison term for subversion and was branded a criminal by authorities. Social media posts about Mr Liu have similarly been censored on Weibo, with Mr Oliver saying himself that: \"Chinese media won't allow mentions of [his] name.\"His wife, Liu Xia, is still held under house arrest by Chinese authorities, and is said to be suffering from depression after spending years under heavy surveillance.\"Xi's crackdown on human rights is apparently the harshest crackdown since Tiananmen square,\" said Mr Oliver in his video. \"[He] has clamped down noticeably on any form of dissident whatsoever.\"It is not uncommon for whole phrases or terms to be censored on Chinese social media. As Mr Oliver points out in his video, the Chinese name for Winnie the Pooh and pictures of the cuddly character were blocked on Weibo after bloggers continually compared him to China's president. China employs millions of people to monitor and censor internet activity and posts deemed to be politically incorrect are routinely deleted. Last Week Tonight is not officially available on Chinese television and YouTube remains blocked in China but clips of the show are available on Chinese video hosting platforms.",

            "content": "It is time we sit and talk about truth and transparency. Every now and then a few disparate things collide, and suddenly you see a pattern. And I don't want this blog to come across as faux naïve. I've covered politics for long enough to know that politicians will try to shape and mould truth to best suit their purposes, to allow them to weaponise the facts that will give them greatest advantage. And I know that politicians love transparency when it best suits them. But in the past two weeks, a line has been crossed. Let me start with something seemingly minor. I was listening to the president and Theresa May at their news conference in the Chequers garden when Donald Trump, talking about Brexit, suddenly made the statement that he had predicted the result when he was at his golf course in Turnberry for the opening of his wonderful golf course the day before the EU referendum in June 2016. I sat up with a jolt. I had been there with him on that trip. We didn't arrive until the day after the referendum. He wasn't there on June 22nd. He was there on June 24th. I pointed this out on Twitter, saying it was a bit bizarre. Now I can see as a bit of storytelling it works better to claim to have been the visionary who saw what was coming; I can also see that when you're 72-years-old you might misremember dates and times. Who doesn't do that occasionally? - although maybe not on something as fundamental as that. Anyway back to my tweet saying the president was factually incorrect. Straight back shot Stephanie Grisham, who is the first lady's director of communications, but more importantly at the time was Donald Trump's press person for the trip to Turnberry. She told me on Twitter the president was right to say what he had said - and she had the photos to prove it. Content is not availableSo we produced the tweet from the president on the 24th saying \"Just arrived in Scotland…\" and from her saying that she had just arrived in Scotland. Someone else found the flight manifest, confirming that the Trump private jet had arrived on the 24th. I fully agree a storm in a teacup. This is not the sort of thing on which world peace hinges. But I struggle to fathom Steph's motives. Why did she go wading in to defend a lie? And why when the proof was provided that she was incorrect did she not just say \"fair enough - my mistake\". Content is not availablePsychology has a rather good word for this - \"gaslighting\". This is the Wikipedia definition of it: Gaslighting is a form of psychological manipulation that seeks to sow seeds of doubt in a targeted individual or in members of a targeted group, making them question their own memory, perception, and sanity. Using persistent denial, misdirection, contradiction, and lying, it attempts to destabilise the victim and delegitimise the victim's belief.From Chequers we now go to Helsinki, and another extraordinary news conference this time with Vladimir Putin. The whole thing was slightly surreal, made more so by the guy sitting next to me being yanked out by the Secret Service after it became clear to them he was planning some kind of protest during the news conference. During the course of the Q and A, Jeff Mason from Reuters was called to ask a question. He wanted to know whether Putin had wanted Donald Trump to win the 2016 presidential election and had directed any of his officials to help him do that?Vladimir Putin didn't hesitate: \"Yes, I wanted him to win because he talked about bringing the US-Russia relationship back to normal.\"It was quite a moment. But then I saw a tweet that Donald Trump put out yesterday to protest about how tough he was with Russia, which read:\"I'm very concerned that Russia will be fighting very hard to have an impact on the upcoming Election. Based on the fact that no President has been tougher on Russia than me, they will be pushing very hard for the Democrats. They definitely don't want Trump!\"So I referred back to what Putin had said in Helsinki a week earlier. But here's where it gets super murky. All reference to that exchange between Mr Mason and the Russian leader has been omitted from the official White House transcript. In the official record it doesn't exist. Just a clerical transcription error? Well maybe - there is some confusion over the translation, but maybe it would be good to correct the record. Now for another random event which happened yesterday. The White House has said that it will no longer provide information about when the president holds conversations with foreign leaders, as it has always done hitherto. The accounts of the chats may have been anodyne and terse, but they were a useful tool to keep track of foreign policy priorities. And it was always useful to compare and contrast what, say, the Kremlin would have to say about the conversation compared to the White House. Now we will no longer be able to do that. And so to the final thing. Donald Trump was speaking at a rally in Kansas City. And he came out with a memorable phrase that sounded as though it had been lifted straight from George Orwell's dystopian novel, 1984. He said: \"Just remember, what you are seeing and what you are reading is not what's happening.\" Or it is. There is just a concerted - and sometimes it would seem - systematic effort to make you think otherwise. Forget alternative facts. This is rewriting history.",

            "title": "Colombia hopes a referendum will help root out corruption",
            "content": "Mention corruption and most Colombians will agree that it is a massive problem.Fifty trillion pesos ($16.8bn, £13bn) have been lost from public resources to corruption, according to Colombia's comptroller general,  Edgardo Maya Villazón.There have been attempts to tackle the problem through laws, more thorough investigations and even by raising public awareness through campaigns. On Sunday, Colombia is going to try something different. Voters will head to the polls in a referendum that its supporters hope will bring about tougher anti-corruption legislation.But even though polls suggest that corruption is Colombians' top concern a \"yes\" vote is not a foregone conclusion by any means.Voters will be asked whether they agree to seven measures:1. A pay cap limiting salaries of members of Congress to 25 times the national minimum wage2. That individuals convicted of corruption serve their full sentence in jail3. That public entities be open and transparent when hiring contractors 4. Letting citizens have a say on the budget5. Require members of Congress to be open about which bills they proposed, how they voted and who lobbied them6. For elected officials to disclose their assets, income, and the taxes paid7. To restrict elected officials to three terms in the same legislative bodyThe referendum is binding but it is only valid if a third of all voters take part - just over 12 million.For each individual measure to be adopted, it needs to receive 50% of valid votes plus one.Congress then has one year to turn the measures into law and make them legally binding. If that does not happen, the president has 15 days to do so through a decree.Non-governmental organisation Transparency for Colombia, says some of the proposed measures would go some way towards rebalancing the ethical relationship between elected officials and the people.But the country's prosecutor-general, Nestor Humberto Martinez, said the steps were \"limited and insufficient\". He has called on President Iván Duque to appoint special anti-corruption judges to handle the growth in the number of corruption cases. Senator Claudia López - one of the proponents of the referendum - argues that the initiative was \"not intended as the sole solution against corruption\".\"We need political-electoral reform and judicial reform. But [the referendum] is a start,\" she said.All parties say they support fighting corruption - the referendum bill cleared the Senate with an impressive 84-0 vote. However, six out of the seven questions had previously been introduced in Congress and defeated in the lower chamber.Germán Manga, a columnist with weekly Semana, has called the questions \"irrelevant, anodyne, almost childish\".He says most of the measures proposed are already covered by current laws.Joaquín Vélez Navarro, a columnist with El Tiempo, has branded the proposals \"pure populism\".His criticism of the referendum includes an attack on the measure to cut the salaries of state officials - which in his view could backfire.\"Such a law could generate incentives for some officials to 'adjust their salaries' through corruption. Or they could put off honest people from dedicating their professional life to public service.\"President Iván Duque entirely eschewed the issue in his inauguration speech on 7 August.Two days later, he presented to Congress a package of four legislative bills aimed at fighting corruption - three of which were included in the points of the referendum.Mr Duque now says he will vote on Sunday - but his governing Democratic Centre party is not actively campaigning for it.Supporters of the referendum want voters to come out in numbers exceeding 15 million. But that turnout will not be easy to achieve.Last June, 19.5 million - or 53% of voters - took part in the second round of presidential elections but turnout at elections tends to draw many more voters than referenda.Meanwhile, Colombian social media is awash with fake news aimed at undermining the vote.One widely circulated myth is that the proposal to lower the salaries of members of Congress would result in a pay cut for ordinary Colombians and pensioners.\"Many [people] are trying to discredit the referendum with fake news,\" Ms López tweeted. \"Do not believe in lies!\"She has urged voters to come out to support the proposals.\"The referendum would be unnecessary if they didn't steal 50 trillion [Colombian pesos] from us.\"",

Earlier this year, tens of thousands of women protested against hidden cameras, carrying signs with messages like \"my life is not your porn\".Activists say women live in constant fear of being photographed or filmed without their knowledge.About 80% of the victims of spy camera porn are women.Seoul's public toilets are currently only inspected for hidden cameras about once a month, Yonhap news agency reports.However, staff who maintain the toilets will now also be required to check them for spy cameras daily.Law enforcement officials have previously told the BBC that it is difficult to catch perpetrators - especially as they can install cameras, and take them down again within 15 minutes. While more than 5,400 people were arrested for spy camera related crimes last year, fewer than 2% of those held were jailed.Yonhap says that the 50 government employees tasked specifically with finding hidden cameras have not discovered any for two years.",

            "content": "Some 400 prisoners have escaped from a facility near the Libyan capital Tripoli amid deadly violence between militia groups in the city, police say. \"The detainees were able to force open the doors\" in order to leave the Ain Zara prison, the local police said.They added that guards, fearing for their lives, were unable to prevent the breakout following riots at the jail. Clashes between militias in the city have led Libya's UN-backed government to declare a state of emergency.The incident on Sunday took place during armed violence between rival factions around the facility, which houses only male inmates.Many of the prisoners held at the Ain Zara prison in south-east Tripoli were reportedly supporters of the late Libyan leader Muammar Gaddafi, and had been found guilty of killings during the uprising against his government in 2011.Separately on Sunday, two people were killed and several others were injured when rockets hit a camp in Libya's capital housing hundreds of displaced people, according to emergency services and witnesses.Libya's Ministry of Health reports that some 47 people, including civilians, have died in rival militia clashes in Tripoli over the past week, with dozens more injured.A UN-backed government is nominally in power in the capital, but militias occupy much of the rest of the country.The violence broke out last week when militias from a city to the south of Tripoli attacked southern areas, leading to fighting with local militias that support the internationally recognised government, the Government of National Accord (GNA).The GNA has described the clashes as \"an attempt to derail peaceful political transition\" in the country, adding that it \"could not remain silent over the attacks on Tripoli and its suburbs, which is a violation of security in the capital and of citizens' safety\".Human Rights Watch has also condemned the violence, adding that at least 18 of the dead were reportedly civilians, among them four children.Hundreds of migrants trapped by the fighting have been moved to other detention centres, while the city's airport was closed for two days on Friday.Libya has faced continuing chaos since Nato-backed militia forces, some of them rivals, overthrew long-serving ruler Colonel Gaddafi in October 2011.UN Secretary General Antonio Guterres has said the \"indiscriminate use of force is a violation of international humanitarian and human rights law\" and has urged \"all parties to grant humanitarian relief for those in need\".On Saturday, the US, UK, France and Italy called for an immediate end to deadly violence in Libya's capital.A joint statement said attempts \"to weaken the legitimate Libyan authorities and hinder the ongoing political process are not acceptable\".\"We are calling on the armed groups to immediately stop all military action and warn those who seek to undermine stability, in Tripoli or elsewhere in Libya, that they will be made accountable for it,\" the joint statement read.However successive attempts at a truce have so far failed to stop the fierce fighting between several militias.

            "title": "Letter from Africa: Heroes and villains of Nigeria's parliament siege",
            "content": "In our series of letters from Africa, Nigerian writer and novelist Adaobi Tricia Nwaubani says scenes resembling a coup in her country have left many scratching their heads.Nigerians still can't say for sure why armed, masked men held our country's parliament under siege last week. But the alarming incident had a most joyous ending.They blocked all entrances to the building, denying lawmakers, civil servants and journalists access.It turned out they were operatives of the state's spy agency, the Department of State Security (DSS), headed by Lawal Daura.  The other man at the centre of the drama is Senate President Bukola Saraki, who recently defected from the ruling APC party to the main opposition PDP.He had called a parliamentary meeting of national assembly leaders - and it was this group that the armed men were blocking.One theory is that it was a strong-arm tactic to make Mr Saraki resign so that the APC can appoint a ruling party senate president in his place.The other theory is that it was all staged to make it appear as if it was officially sanctioned to make the government look bad.Neither theory stands up to logical scrutiny, but you should never let anything surprise when it comes to the antics of Nigerian politics.In April, a disgruntled MP allegedly organised for intruders to storm the Senate and steal its mace.Decisions in the upper chamber cannot be approved without the mace - a large ornamental staff that represents the legislature's authority. But when news spread of the events last week, including videos of angry lawmakers in confrontation with the armed state operatives, even Nigerians expressed their condemnation.   President Muhammadu Buhari was away in the UK on vacation, leaving his deputy Yemi Osinbajo in charge. Adaobi Tricia Nwaubani:\"Nothing about Yemi Osinbajo excites the usual comedy that Nigerians have come to expect from our leaders\"\"Nigeria is a democracy not a military dictatorship,\" said Atiku Abubakar, a former vice-president and PDP presidential hopeful.\"The acting president, being himself a professor of law, ought to know that setting such a precedent is an invitation to anarchy.\"And indeed it was Mr Osinbajo who became the hero of the day. Not only is Mr Osinbajo a professor of law and a former commissioner for justice, he is arguably one of the most distinguished leaders to have graced the Nigerian seat of power in the past few decades.For starters, nothing about him excites the usual comedy that Nigerians have come to expect from our leaders.His educational qualifications are without suspicion. His foot does not get jammed in his mouth each time he speaks. He has no known girlfriends flaunting flashy cars and shady contracts around the capital city, Abuja. He has no known cadavers stinking in his cupboard.   Mr Osinbajo has even been heard to apologise after arriving late at events. The typical Nigerian public office holder's self-importance can usually be measured by how long they can keep people waiting.And the vice-president did not disappoint. While the siege was ongoing, he released a statement denouncing it as \"condemnable and completely unacceptable\". Then he announced the immediate dismissal of Mr Daura - and the masked men were recalled to their lair. Again, Nigerians can't say for sure if Mr Daura was simply a scapegoat for a failed coup, or if he was indeed acting without presidential authority, motivated by his loyalty to Mr Buhari, his kinsman from the village of Daura in Katsina state, north-western Nigeria. But, I promised you a happy ending, didn't I? Many Nigerians feel that if it took the siege on parliament to be finally rid of the spy chief - then hurray.In 2015, the sexagenarian was exhumed from retirement and appointed to head the DSS. In the past three years of Mr Daura's leadership, the agency has been characterised by midnight arrests on those suspected of corruption, disdain for court orders, detention of a journalist without trial, and the harassing of lawmakers at a federal and state level.Many Nigerians feared that as he came from Mr Buhari's hometown it had made him untouchable.We had resigned ourselves to the ongoing nightmare.But, as the saying goes: he whom the gods wish to destroy, they first make mad. The madness that Mr Daura seemed to display by launching the siege has now led to his ignominious fall.On the acting president's orders, Mr Daura was arrested and although released a few days later, his passport was seized. Mr Osinbajo described his antics as \"a gross violation of constitutional order, rule of law and all accepted notions of law and order\". Mr Daura has yet to put his side of events.But many Nigerians are now hoping that he will have that opportunity in court. What an even more joyous ending that would be - and one that follows the rule of law. Follow us on Twitter @BBCAfrica, on Facebook at BBC Africa or on Instagram at bbcafrica",

            "title": "Australia abuse inquiry: Catholic Church rejects call to overhaul confession",
            "content": "The Catholic Church in Australia has formally rejected a landmark inquiry's recommendation that priests should be forced to report sexual abuse disclosed during confession.The five-year inquiry found tens of thousands of children had suffered abuse in Australian institutions. The Catholic Church had the most cases.On Friday, Church leaders accepted most of the inquiry's recommendations.But their stance on confession may set up future conflict with governments.The Australian Catholic Bishops Conference said breaking the seal of confession was \"contrary to our faith and inimical to religious liberty\".\"We are committed to the safeguarding of children and vulnerable people while maintaining the seal,\" it said in a statement.The Church leaders said they would, however, explore other proposals - including asking the Vatican to relax rules on celibacy.The royal commission inquiry, which concluded in December, heard more than 8,000 testimonies about abuse in churches, schools and sports clubs.2559allegations referred to police since the inquiry began in 2013230 prosecutions have commenced 41,770 calls received from members of the public 60,000 survivors may be eligible for compensation, estimates say Its final report made more than 400 recommendations across government and other institutional sectors. The government called the abuse a \"national tragedy\", began a compensation scheme for survivors, and said it would give a national apology on 22 October.Religious ministers and schoolteachers were found to be the most common perpetrators. The inquiry heard they included 7% of Australia's Catholic priests between 1950 and 2010.The commissioners recommended that Catholic clerics should face criminal charges if they failed to report sexual abuse disclosed to them during confession.It also said the Catholic Church should consider making celibacy voluntary for priests because while it was \"not a direct cause of child sexual abuse\", it had \"contributed to the occurrence of child sexual abuse, especially when combined with other risk factors\".The Catholic Church had already opted in to the compensation scheme, which will give survivors payments of up to A$150,000 (£85,000; $110,000) each.However, Church leaders have consistently ruled out making changes to confession.Additionally, they asserted that new rules would make perpetrators or victims less likely to disclose abuse during confession.But they vowed to end the cover-up of abuse - echoing recent statements by the Pope - and committed to several actions, including:Archbishop of Brisbane Mark Coleridge said there was a \"dark side\" to mandatory celibacy, but conceded that the Holy See was unlikely to act quickly, if at all, in making significant changes.The state of South Australia has already unveiled new laws - to take effect in October - that will legally compel clergy to report abuse.However, Church leaders have vowed not to adhere to it. State officials say this may lead to prosecutions, resulting in fines of up to A$10,000 (£5,570; $7,250).In June, Victoria's attorney-general, Martin Pakula, said other states were working \"to develop a nationally consistent approach on this important issue\".",

            "title": "Russia's Putin embraces higher pension age but softens blow",
            "content": "For a long time Vladimir Putin distanced himself from Russia's pension reform. It was always expected to be highly controversial and the idea was for the government to propose the tough reform and take the flak. But the street protests grew and President Putin's approval rating fell, regardless. So now, as if on cue, he has ridden to the rescue - cast as Vladimir the Benevolent, stepping in to soften the blow.Any notion that he would simply scrap the reform, or overhaul it significantly, was soon scotched.From the start of his speech, simulcast on all state TV channels, Mr Putin went to great lengths to explain that raising the retirement age was essential. Acknowledging that he had once promised never to take this step as president, he argued that times - and the economic environment - had changed. Too many pensioners and too few workers were putting an intolerable pressure on state finances. If nothing changed, the president warned, the system would first crack and then collapse.His tone veered from kindly and sympathetic - calling viewers his \"dear friends\" and stressing that he shared their concern - to stern. \"We really can't delay any more,\" Mr Putin insisted. \"That would be irresponsible.\"#Putin: this pension reform cannot be put off. If we don’t show decisiveness now, the stability of society will be threatened and so the security of our country. I ask for your understanding pic.twitter.com/VGEYA3qGQAEnd of Twitter post  by @sarahrainsfordHe cast pension reform as a matter of national security. The president did offer some mild relief from the initial proposal for Russian women. As Russia \"cares\" for its women, he said, they would have to work only five extra years before retirement at 60, instead of eight. That can be cut further, mind you, if they have extra children - basically producing extra workers to contribute to the pension pot.On the other hand, those mothers will probably have to stay at home to care for their bigger brood. At the moment, many grandmothers help raise children once they retire at 55. Under the new system, they would be working.But the biggest bone of contention is male workers. Vladimir Putin left the new retirement age for men at 65, a five-year increase. His argument is that life expectancy has leapt up under his rule, which is certainly true compared to the dire post-Soviet crisis of the 1990s. But Russian men still only live to 67 on average. Under the new system a huge number would not survive to collect their pension. More money, then, for that \"cracking\" system.The Kremlin says Mr Putin has intervened on this issue because of its importance, not to boost his flagging rating. His spokesman, Dmitry Peskov, told the BBC it was a \"brave step, in Putin's style\" and state TV has now gone into overdrive promoting it and the pension reform. However, supporters of opposition politician Alexei Navalny have reacted to the speech by posting fresh calls to a protest on 9 September. Mr Navalny himself was sentenced to 30 days in custody this week, a step he argues was meant to hinder preparations for rallies against the reform across the country.And on the streets, Russians' initial reaction has been cool. One woman, Irina, blamed foreign policy and sanctions for the lack of cash in the pension pot. A man called Sergei said he feared there would be no money at all by the time he reached retirement. The risk for Russia's president, of course, is that while this unpopular move could once be pinned firmly on the government - it's now very much Vladimir Putin's proposal. ",

            "title": "Why is Libya so lawless?",
            "content": "Libya has been beset by chaos since Nato-backed forces overthrew long-serving ruler Col Muammar Gaddafi in October 2011. Western powers are now becoming increasingly concerned that so-called Islamic State (IS) has built a presence in the North African state and the US has responded by launching air strikes on the militant group. Only Libya's myriad armed militias really wield power - and it is felt they often hold the politicians they supposedly back to ransom.During the uprising, anyone with a gun could command respect, and lots of armed groups emerged - up to 1,700, according to some estimates.There are two rival parliaments and three governments - the latest government was formed in UN-brokered talks with the aim of replacing the other two. But this initiative is still on the rocks, partly because of concerns that the new government is being imposed by Western powers. The oil-rich country once had one of the highest standards of living in Africa, with free healthcare and free education, but six years on from the uprising, it is facing a financial crisis.This turmoil has allowed IS to gain a foothold in the country.Top IS leaders 'take refuge' in LibyaIS had taken control of an \"enclave\" in and around the city of Sirte, the birthplace of Gaddafi. Security experts feared this could provide a safe haven for jihadists to train, fund and plan attacks in North Africa and across the Mediterranean.However, pro-government forces backed by the West have now pushed back the Islamists and retaken the city.Some security analysts describe Libya as an arms bazaar. It is awash with weapons looted from Gaddafi's arsenal - making an ideal playground for jihadists fleeing air strikes in Syria and Iraq.IS has been attacking Libyan oil facilities, has kidnapped several foreign oil workers and in 2015 was behind two high-profile attacks on Tunisia's tourism industry - carried out by gunmen trained in Libya.Tunisia has built a partial security barrier and trench along its border with Libya aimed at preventing further atrocities.Beheadings and racial tension: Life under Islamic StateHow IS's Libya foothold threatens UKThe Libyans gaining ground on ISThe US has carried out at least four known air strikes in Libya since 2015. The latest one, in January, targeted an alleged training camp on the outskirts of Sirte where some IS militants had fled after the city fell. The UK and France also have special forces operating in the North African state - the nature and extent of these operations have largely been secretive.Three French soldiers died in July 2016 when their helicopter was shot down by militiamen who identified themselves as belonging to a new militant group called Benghazi Defence Brigades (BDB).  Last year, plans were unveiled to send 6,000 troops from a number of Nato countries, including the UK and France, to Libya to train local troops to stop IS-linked groups from gaining more territory and to provide security to diplomatic missions that were looking to move back to the capital. However, the new unity government was reluctant to openly allow or request such a presence and the plan has still not materialised.Former US President Barack Obama, in an interview published in April 2016, said that the \"worst mistake\" of his presidency was the failure to prepare for the aftermath of Col Gaddafi's overthrow.  He partly blamed then-UK Prime Minister David Cameron for \"the mess\", saying he had not done enough to support the North African nation whose instability was threatening its neighbours and was a factor in Europe's migrant crisis.Parliamentary elections held in 2014 were disputed. Those who held power refused to give it up and remained in the capital, Tripoli.The newly elected parliament then moved to the port of Tobruk, 1,000km (620 miles) away and set up a rival government. This parliament still has the official backing of the UN as Libya's official legislative body - despite the fact that it is opposed to the new unity administration. It wants Gen Khalifa Haftar, who is leading the battle against Islamist militias, to keep a senior role in a future army, something the UN agreement does not guarantee.The UN-mediated deal for a unity government has seen the formation of a nine-member Presidency Council, led by Prime Minister Fayez Sarraj. He arrived in Tripoli in March 2016 to set up his administration and has been trying to win the support of the various militias and politicians, but it has little real power over the whole country.The council has also suffered from divisions. Two members boycotted it continuously, eventually moving to the east, while another member resigned.Mr Sarraj, an engineer by profession, approved the 1 August 2016 US air strike on suspected IS positions in Sirte, in the first co-ordinated military action between his government and the US.Has Libya pulled back from the brink?They were united in their hatred for Gaddafi - but nothing more. There was no single group in charge of the rebellion. Militias were based in different cities, fighting their own battles. They are also ideologically divided - some of them are militant or moderate Islamists, others are secessionists or monarchists and yet others are liberals. Furthermore, the militias are split along regional, ethnic and local lines, making it a combustible mix. And after more than four decades of authoritarian rule, they had little understanding of democracy. So they were unable to forge compromises and build a new state based on the rule of law.

            "content": " A Yazidi teenager sold into slavery by Islamic State has told the BBC of her horror after she escaped to Germany, only to come face-to-face with her captor in the street.Ashwaq was only 14 when Islamic State fighters stormed into northern Iraq, including the heartland of the Yazidi people. They took thousands of women as sex slaves, including Ashwaq - sold for $100 to a man named Abu Humam.Raped and beaten, she managed to escape three months later and then went to Germany with her mother and one brother.A few months ago, on the street outside a supermarket, she heard someone call out her name.Ashwaq told the BBC: \"On the way back to school a car pulled up next to me. He was sitting in the front seat. He talked to me in German and asked: 'Are you Ashwaq?' I was so scared I was shaking. I said: 'No, who are you?'\"She said he then replied: \"I know you are Ashwaq, and I am Abu Humam.\"Ashwaq said he then started to talk to her in Arabic and told her not to lie to him. \"I know you, he said. And where you live and who you live with. He knew everything about my life in Germany.\"She added: \"I never in my life believed that I would see something like this in Germany. \"I left my family and my country and went to Germany to forget the beating and the pain. The last thing I expected was to meet my IS captor and that he would know everything about me.\" Germany's federal prosecutor says Ashwaq reported the incident to the police five days after she said it took place. Ashwaq says she told investigators everything, including her harrowing experiences in Iraq.Officers made an e-fit of the suspect and told her to contact the police immediately if she saw Abu Humam again.She says she also told the police to check the supermarket's CCTV, but says this did not happen. \"I waited a whole month,\" she says, but received no news. Fearful that she would see her captor again and wishing to be reunited with four of her sisters who had since been rescued from IS, Ashwaq returned to northern Iraq, leaving behind the town of Schwäbisch Gmünd where she had hoped to start a new life. \"If you haven't been through it, you won't know what it's like... it goes straight to your heart,\" she said. \"When a girl is raped by IS, you can't imagine what it's like when you see this guy again.\"Frauke Köhler, a spokeswoman for Germany's top court, says police made every effort to locate Abu Humam using the e-fit image and Ashwaq's testimony, but were unable to find him.By the time they contacted her again in June this year as part of the investigation, Ashwaq had already left for Iraq.However, activists in Germany say her case may not be an isolated incident. Düzen Tekkal, an activist and the founder of Hawar.Help, a Berlin-based organisation which campaigns for Yazidi rights, says she has heard of several cases where female Yazidi refugees recognised IS fighters in Germany.Ashwaq herself says she heard similar accounts from other Yazidi girls who had escaped the jihadists. Not all cases are reported to the authorities, however. Back in Kurdistan now living in a Yazidi camp, Ashwaq still wants to continue her education but both she and her family also want to leave the country.\"We're scared of the people of IS,\" her father told the BBC. But her experience in Germany has had a profound impact on Ashwaq.\"If the world was destroyed, I would not go to Germany again,\" she said.Like many Yazidis, her family is now applying to live in Australia as part of a special programme for women abducted by IS.",

            "content": "The US military says it is cancelling $300m (£230m) in aid to Pakistan over what it calls Islamabad's failure to take action against militant groups. President Donald Trump has previously accused Pakistan of deceiving the US while receiving billions of dollars.Pentagon spokesman Lt Col Koné Faulkner said the US military would aim to spend the money on other \"urgent priorities\".The move, which needs to be approved by the US Congress, is part of a broader suspension announced in January.The US state department has criticised Pakistan, a key ally, for failing to deal with terrorist networks operating on its soil, including the Haqqani network and the Afghan Taliban.\"We continue to press Pakistan to indiscriminately target all terrorist groups,\" Col Faulkner said in a statement on Saturday, adding that the $300m aid - which had earlier been suspended - should be used elsewhere due to \"a lack of Pakistani decisive actions\" in tackling the issue. The announcement comes just days before US Secretary of State Mike Pompeo is due to visit Pakistan to meet the country's new prime minister, Imran Khan.In January, the US government announced it was cutting almost all security aid to the country.The US and others have long complained that Pakistan provides a safe haven to militant networks, allowing them to carry out cross-border attacks in Afghanistan - something that Islamabad denies. There was no immediate comment from Pakistan on the latest funding cut. However, the military responded to January's suspension by arguing that it \"never fought for money but for peace\", and had targeted all militants at a \"heavy cost of blood and treasure\". Separately on Friday, the US said it was ending all funding for the UN's Palestinian refugee agency - the United Nations Relief and Works Agency (Unrwa) - which it described as \"irredeemably flawed\".The Haqqani network is a militant group that focuses most of its activities on neighbouring Afghanistan, which has complained for years that Pakistan allows it to operate unimpeded from its soil across the border.The group is linked to the Afghan Taliban - a hardline Islamist movement that poses a major threat to the Afghan government. Pakistani Taliban groups, while associated with the Afghan Taliban, focus on attacks within Pakistan.Both the Haqqani Network and the Afghan Taliban have launched attacks in Afghanistan that have killed US forces, and US officials have long argued that Pakistan, and specifically its ISI intelligence service, provides safe havens to them.Pakistan has long been accused of using the Afghan Taliban to further its foreign policy interests in the country. The ISI first became involved in funding and training militants in Afghanistan after the Soviet invasion in 1979.Although since 2001 Pakistan has allowed its territory to be used to supply international troops during the war in Afghanistan, and co-operated with the West in fighting some terrorists groups like al-Qaeda, analysts say it has continued to give shelter and support to Afghan insurgents.Its aim has been to limit the influence in Afghanistan of its chief regional rival, India.",

            "title": "Malcolm Turnbull: Six moments that defined Australia's ex-PM",
            "content": "His time in power was relatively brief, eventful, and like many recent Australian leaders, abruptly terminated without an election.Here are moments that loomed large in Malcolm Turnbull's three-year prime ministership, before his messy ouster by party rivals on Friday.Mr Turnbull is hardly new to internal chaos. As opposition leader in 2009, he was unseated by Tony Abbott. The latter became PM in 2013, but - and stay with us - Mr Turnbull then ousted him in 2015.In doing so, Mr Turnbull used a justification that would come back to haunt him: \"We have lost 30 Newspolls [opinion polls] in a row. It is clear that the people have made up their mind about Mr Abbott's leadership.\"Once in office, Mr Turnbull tried to differentiate himself in various ways - including by promoting more women to cabinet, and dropping an unpopular policy of conferring knights and dames.Mr Abbott had vowed \"no wrecking, no undermining, and no sniping\" of the government, but his subsequent criticisms dogged Mr Turnbull. When Mr Turnbull lost his 30th opinion poll this year, Mr Abbott publicly called on him \"to explain\". Same-sex couples could not legally wed when Mr Turnbull came to power. Although a vocal supporter of change, he drew criticism by achieving it through a national postal vote last year.Same-sex marriage advocates had warned the ballot would unleash hate campaigns - and it did become heated in many instances, with blame on both sides.Others praised the prime minister for breaking a government deadlock on the issue, paving the way for marriage equality to be signed into law last December.\"What a day for love, for equality, for respect,\" Mr Turnbull said after a vote by MPs. \"Australia has done it.\"Last year, several Australian lawmakers were ensnared in a constitutional eligibility crisis over their dual citizenship.It was no concern for Mr Turnbull until his deputy, Barnaby Joyce, was told he had New Zealand citizenship - a fact that was news to him.Mr Joyce was soon disqualified from office, imperilling Mr Turnbull's one-seat majority in the House of Representatives. Fortunately for the government, Mr Joyce was returned at a by-election - prompting a hands-aloft celebration with a relieved Mr Turnbull.Their unity was not to last, however. When Mr Joyce was later embroiled in a scandal over an affair, the pair traded personal barbs in public. Mr Joyce later stood down.Mr Turnbull's relationship with the US president got off to a famously testy start last year, with Mr Trump calling it \"the worst by far\" of all his post-election phone calls.Mr Trump had been unhappy with an Obama-era refugee deal, describing it as \"dumb\" before later telling Canberra he would uphold it.It was a rare low point in Australia's relationship with the US, its chief ally.Mr Turnbull appeared to warm to Mr Trump, however, and vocally defended him as an \"American patriot\" last month when the US president briefly contradicted his own intelligence agencies' position on Russian interference.On the global stage, Mr Turnbull's tenure was also defined by strained ties with China.Last year, he announced sweeping new laws to prevent foreign interference. In explaining why they were needed, Mr Turnbull referred to \"disturbing reports about Chinese influence\" - but insisted that was not their sole focus.Nonetheless it intensified discussion - and suspicion - that Australia's largest trading partner could be \"infiltrating\" its politics and universities.China responded by accusing Australian politicians and media of stoking \"hysteria\" and a \"Cold War mentality\".In a bid to ease tensions, Mr Turnbull gave a conciliatory speech in August in which he promised \"clearer thinking\" on China.This was the catalyst for Mr Turnbull's demise. After poor polls and by-election defeats, Mr Turnbull needed a win with his signature energy policy.Despite gaining support from a majority of government MPs, a vocal group of conservatives were unhappy with the policy and instigated a rebellion.It forced Mr Turnbull into an embarrassing U-turn on Monday, in which he scrapped plans for the policy to contain an emissions target.But it did not offset leadership rumblings. They gathered pace, and were soon seen as terminal for Mr Turnbull.",

            "title": "Ending Yemen’s never-ending war",
            "content": "\"Some people say we are in a hurry,\" says Martin Griffiths, the UN's special envoy for Yemen. \"I plead guilty to the charge.\"\"The people of Yemen have suffered quite enough. It's time.\"An air strike two weeks ago that took the lives of 44 schoolboys on a field trip, shocking even in a nation shattered by years of strife, has focused minds again on the urgent need to end a conflict that has led to the world's greatest humanitarian crisis.Mr Griffiths has now sent formal invitations to the warring parties to attend a new round of consultations in Geneva on 6 September. They will be the first talks in two years, after two failed rounds. \"The good news is, the government of Yemen wants to do this. And the Ansar Allah leadership does too,\" he says, using the official name of the rebel Houthi movement that took control of the capital Sanaa in 2014 and forced President Abdrabbuh Mansour Hadi to flee abroad the following year. Yemen's government has been backed militarily since March 2015 by a coalition of Arab states assembled by neighbouring Saudi Arabia to oust the Houthis, who are aligned to its arch-rival Iran. This punishing proxy war in the region's poorest nation has ground on, dragging Yemen to the brink of collapse. The deadly Saudi-led coalition air strike on the bus in the rebel-held northern village of Dahyan on 9 August has threatened to derail a fragile political process fraught with risk. Mr Griffiths, who took on his new role in March, is the third UN special envoy since 2011, when an Arab Spring uprising forced long-time leader Ali Abdullah Saleh to hand over power to Mr Hadi.\"There's anger and defiance,\" explains one official closely involved in the UN's new effort to find a negotiated solution to Yemen's appalling plight. \"The Houthis have been threatening not to attend because they fear the investigation into this attack will not be credible.\"Images of bloodied schoolboys, bright blue Unicef schoolbags still on their backs, sparked an international outcry and a call by the UN Security Council for a \"credible and transparent\" investigation. Fifty-five people were killed in all, and many more injured, when a bomb struck the school bus as its driver stopped to buy snacks at a bustling market. A coalition military spokesman initially said its forces attacked a \"legitimate military target\" after debris from a Houthi missile intercepted over southern Saudi Arabia killed one person and injured 11 others. Now, the coalition has said it is investigating the reports of \"collateral damage\" and will compensate victims if necessary.This latest tragedy has also reignited public criticism over the role of Western countries, including the UK and US, which are backing the coalition through billions of dollars in arms sales and operational support. The bomb deployed in the latest devastating attack which pulverised the school bus was reportedly provided by a US arms manufacturer. \"The bus attack will certainly add to pressure on Saudi Arabia and the United Arab Emirates to move toward a negotiated end to the war,\" assesses Joost Hiltermann of the International Crisis Group. \"But I'm not convinced that this will be decisive.\" Earlier this year, Mr Griffiths' sustained shuttle diplomacy and the anguished appeals of aid agencies averted an all-out assault by pro-government forces on the vital Red Sea port of Hudaydah, and the adjacent city, currently in Houthi hands. Most of the humanitarian aid on which 80% of Yemenis rely for survival comes through Hudaydah.But it also convinced the UAE, which took the lead on the Hudaydah offensive, that only a ratcheting up of military pressure would bring Houthi leaders to the negotiating table, ready to do a deal.Under greater threat, Houthi leaders had told Mr Griffiths they were prepared to hand over Hudaydah port to UN administration, a move they had resisted for years. Then the coalition shifted the goalposts. They demanded rebels withdraw from the city too. \"We think more military pressure still needs to be exerted on the Houthis,\" insists an Arab official in the coalition, underlining that victory in Hudaydah would be a game-changer that would bring a swift end to this war. But the assault against such a large city, where well-trained Houthi fighters are now entrenched, has also proven to be far more daunting than the first coalition military plans envisaged. \"The UAE and its allies have come to realise just how much it will cost them in blood and treasure, as well as in how they'll be viewed,\" comments one observer. A diplomatic source says that, in June, as the first onslaught on Hudaydah loomed, then UK Foreign Secretary Boris Johnson called UAE diplomats to urge them to give Mr Griffiths more time to come up with a negotiated solution. Mr Johnson is said to have warned of another Stalingrad - an allusion to shocking images of destruction in World War Two. Ever since the UN envoy first announced his plan to launch a new political process, all sides have expressed support for his efforts. But they have voiced pessimism too. And while the US and UK governments are known to raise concerns about coalition military tactics in private with Saudi Arabia and the UAE, in public they defend their long-standing allies.\"There's a strong impression that they support the man, but not the plan,\" is how a Western Yemen expert puts their approach to Mr Griffith's mission. \"That's them having their cake and eating it too,\" he explained. \"They say: 'We totally want Martin to create peace, but if his plan upsets our partners, we're not going to push.'\"Iran's role is also a factor. But the extent of its military support, and its sway over the Houthis, is disputed.\"The Iranians play a role in allowing the Houthis to believe they can hold out,\" says Mr Hiltermann. \"But the Houthis have shown in the past that the Iranians don't have that much influence over them.\" The bar has deliberately been set low for this next round of talks in Geneva. But some observers see rare glimmers of hope. \"There's fatigue,\" points out one analyst following the process closely. \"Yemenis are exhausted by this conflict.\" And the arrival of the experienced, plain-speaking UN mediator has translated into enhanced access in all capitals, including meetings with senior Houthi leaders. \"The Houthis are now willing, and not afraid, to make concessions they weren't a year ago including on Hudaydah,\" a Yemen expert added. Sources say the rebel leaders have made new offers, including a proposal to freeze the fighting, as well as alternative arrangements for Hudaydah city. Geneva will only be talks about talks, an informal discussion only among Yemenis. The ambition is to move gradually towards more substantive negotiations in a broad process that draws on dialogue in backchannels, shuttling between capitals, and engagement with Yemenis across civil society. Mr Griffiths describes the goal as a \"transitional political operation under a national unity government... and security arrangements for the withdrawal of all armed groups.\"\"Baby steps, just baby steps,\" is the phrase used by Bashraheel Hisham Bashraheel, deputy editor-in-chief of Al-Ayam newspaper in the southern Yemeni city of Aden, which is under government control. Like baby steps, there's a great risk this new process will falter - just like the last two rounds. \"Geneva will be a beginning,\" says Mr Griffiths. \"Even a beginning is good.\" ",

            "title": "South Africa: The groups playing on the fears of a 'white genocide’",
            "content": "Taking a swipe at UK Prime Minister Theresa May as she struggled to dance with schoolchildren during her visit to South Africa this week, controversial British columnist Katie Hopkins tweeted: \"Whites are being slaughtered in South Africa & inexplicably Appeaser May chooses to crucify herself\".Hopkins' tweet was the latest example of a global campaign to portray South Africa's once dominant white population as a victimised minority under attack. \"The violent, ethnic cleansing of white farmers by armed, black gangs is infuriating & heartbreaking. And the world doesn't care. Or at least the mainstream media doesn't care. Do you?\" she added. Her comments reflect the growing influence of South Africa's conservative Afrikaner groups who are conducting global lobbying campaigns to support their message that white farmers are being targeted and killed, that the government is seizing their land, they are being discriminated against by affirmative action programmes and that their language is being sidelined.US President Donald Trump has also taken up the cudgels on their behalf, tweeting last week that he had asked Secretary of State Mike Pompeo to closely study \"land and farm seizures and expropriations and the large scale killing of farmers\" in South Africa. Between April 2016 and March 2017, 74 people - of all races - were murdered on farms in South Africa, according to police figures, compared to more than 19,000 murders nationwide in the same period.The BBC has found that there is no reliable data to suggest farmers are at greater risk of being murdered than the average South African.On the land question, the government has not yet started seizing farms but says it will change the constitution to allow it to expropriate land without compensation, hence the intense lobbying by those linked to farmers.The government says this is needed to reverse the forced eviction of black farmers under white minority rule.Mr Trump's intervention was a political coup for AfriForum - the main South African lobby group championing the cause of Afrikaners, especially farmers. \"They [Afriforum] are gripped in a siege mentality. They can't see a world where their privilege is challenged. They disregard history,\" said University of South Africa political analyst Somadoda Fikeni. More than 24 years after the end of apartheid, white people enjoy average standards of living far higher than black South Africans.But Mr Fikeni accepts that it is unlikely that groups like AfriForum will give in easily. \"Afrikaner nationalism was built around farming and language, so they see this as an existential crisis,\" he said.AfriForum's leaders, Kallie Kriel and Ernest Roets, toured the US earlier this year, meeting conservative think-tanks, the government's international aid agency USAid, and Mr Trump's security adviser John Bolton, who was given a book which alleges that the South African government is complicit in the killing of white farmers, or boers.  But the main influence on Mr Trump's tweet was Fox News' Tucker Carlson, who aired a programme about farm killings, and who had also hosted Mr Roets during AfriForum's US tour.  Mr Roets welcomed the tweet - despite the fact that it incorrectly claimed the South African government was \"now seizing land\".\"I think our lobbying has certainly had an impact because we have spoken with a lot of people who have had contact with President Trump and we have spoken with many think tanks, one of them, for example, the Cato Institute, which has taken a very strong stance shortly before this statement by President Trump.\"Mr Kriel told the BBC that he did not believe the \"wording\" of the tweet should be debated, and the focus should instead be on protecting property rights rather than allowing the South African government to press ahead with its plans. \"A crisis can be averted if there is international pressure. If you turn a blind eye, it can bring us to the position of Zimbabwe. We don't want the country to be destroyed,\" he said. The chaotic and sometimes violent seizure of white-owned land in neighbouring Zimbabwe, which had a similar history of European settlement, has been widely blamed for wrecking the country's once prosperous economy.AfriForum is not the only Afrikaner group which has lobbied in the US. Another one is the far smaller and more extreme Suidlanders (Afrikaans for Southlanders), whose members Simon Roche and André Coetzee carried out a six-month visit to the US last year. They met various far-right activists, including David Duke, the former Grand Wizard of the Ku Klux Klan and Trump supporter, as well as other white supremacists and Nazi sympathisers, according to South African journalist Lloyd Gedye.\"This network has allowed the Suidlanders to spread its message of 'white genocide' around the world,\" he wrote in the Mail & Guardian newspaper.This includes Australia, where several right-wing rallies have been held this year with protesters - many of them white South African migrants - holding up placards such as \"Recognise the genocide\" and \"Stop the murders\". The message has resonated with Australia's former Home Affairs Minister Peter Dutton who said in March that he was looking at giving South Africa's white farmers access to fast-track visas because they were being \"persecuted\" and needed help from a \"civilised\" country.This prompted outrage from the South African government.Mr Fikeni told the BBC that international support for South Africa's white farmers was not surprising, and tied in with the votes for Brexit and Donald Trump, and the rise of right-wing parties across Europe. \"The anti-establishment is growing across the world, partly because of immigration pressures. There are those who feel local cultures are being invaded, who want whiteness to be maintained in its purest form,\" the political analyst said. The view that white South Africans are at risk of a \"genocide\" has also been taken up by members of the Europe of Nations and Freedom Group, a small right-wing group in the European parliament. British national Janice Atkinson - who serves in the parliament as an independent after being expelled by the pro-Brexit UK Independence Party (UKIP) - unsuccessfully pushed for a parliamentary debate on South African farm murders last November. In February, Ms Atkinson - who has built strong relations with South Africa's right-wing Freedom Front Plus - wrote to then-UK Foreign Secretary Boris Johnson, urging him to push the South African government to drop its land reform plans. Trump's tweet and the factsIs South Africa's land reform an election gimmick?South Africans' anger over land set to explodeShe added that South Africa \"is on the brink of another Zimbabwe\" and quoted Freedom Front Plus leader Connie Mulder, as saying that South Africa \"could slip into a Rwandan situation\". Some 800,000 people were killed in the 1994 genocide in the East African country. \"The world must open its eyes now to what is happening. If it does not it will have blood on its hands for not acting to prevent what will, tragically, be an entirely predictable catastrophe,\" she wrote.Mr Kriel said AfriForum believed that as South Africa was its former colony, the UK had an \"extra responsibility\" to put pressure on the African National Congress (ANC) government not to expropriate land without compensation. But Mrs May, during her visit to South Africa, said she supported measures that were legal and transparent and she welcomed President Cyril Ramaphosa's assurances there would be \"no smash and grab\" seizures of land.The editor of the UK-based Africa Confidential publication, Patrick Smith, said he believed that Mrs May's comments were \"recommended by the Foreign and Commonwealth Office to differentiate the UK's position from that of Trump and his white nationalist pals\". Since the vote to leave the European Union, the UK government was \"working hard to get a foothold in markets it hasn't paid attention to\" so it was unlikely to strain relations with the South African government over land, Mr Smith added. Unlike other groups, AfriForum was not claiming that there was a genocide against white South Africans, but there were \"elements\" of it, like inflammatory rhetoric and the brutal murder of farmers, Mr Kriel said. In 2011, the High Court banned the song Shoot the Boer - then the political signature tune of radical Economic Freedom Front (EFF) leader Julius Malema - saying it amounted to hate speech. \"The words of one person inciting others... that's how a genocide can start,\" said Judge Collin Lamont as he delivered his judgement on Mr Malema, whose vocal, and popular, calls for land reform have pushed the ANC to toughen its position.Mr Kriel said AfriForum believed that the ANC's land reform plan had reneged on the pact reached with Afrikaners when apartheid ended in 1994.  \"There is supposed to be a just system where there is no infringement of human rights and property rights,\" he said.But for Mr Fikeni, AfriForum is selectively reading the constitution, which outlines the rights of all South Africans. \"There needs to be redistribution to address the wrongs of the past. You can't talk about reconciliation and forget social justice,\" he said. ",

            "title": "Russia pension protests: Fresh anti-reform rallies held",
            "content": "Further protests against pension reforms have taken place in Russia, despite the recent concessions offered by President Vladimir Putin. Independent observers say more than 10,000 people took part in rallies in Moscow. Other cities also saw demonstrations.The initial proposal was to raise the retirement age for women to 63 from 55, and for men to 65 from 60.On Wednesday he said the pension age for women would only be raised to 60. Mr Putin has said reform is a financial necessity, but it has been met with a hostile reception and led to a steep fall in his popularity. Unions have warned that many will not live long enough to claim a pension. Russian men have a life expectancy of 66 while for women it is 77, the World Health Organization says.Under the new plan, to be implemented from 2019, the retirement age for men will be increased gradually from 60 to 65.Before Mr Putin's intervention women were to have to work another eight years from 55 to 63 - their planned retirement age has now been reduced to 60.Women with three or more children could retire earlier, Mr Putin said.Prime Minister Dmitry Medvedev has previously said the decision was motivated by the fact that Russians are living longer and leading more active lives.He said there were 12 million working pensioners in Russia, equal to nearly a quarter of all pensioners.In a TV address last week, Mr Putin said the move to raise the retirement age for men and women had been delayed for years and risked causing inflation and increasing poverty.Postponing it further would threaten the stability and security of Russian society, he said.\"Any further delay would be irresponsible,\" he said. \"Our decisions should be just and well-balanced.\"Until his TV address he had attempted to distance himself from the row, and had in the past promised that the pension age would never be raised on his watch.Tens of thousands have rallied across Russia in recent weeks.Sunday's Moscow protest saw many carrying the red flags and banners of the Communist Party, the principal organiser of the protest.A smaller protest was held by the centre-left Just Russia party, which police said attracted some 1,500 people.Unusually for Russia, protesters against the reforms come from all sides of the political debate.The initial announcement was made at the same time as the World Cup in Russia began, prompting criticism that the Russian government was trying to bury bad news.Most economists and many Russians agree there is a problem. The population is getting older and the state is spending more and more on pensions.After the economic chaos of the early 1990s, Russia's population plummeted. The birth rate has since shown some signs of improvement, but it is not happening fast enough.Based on current trends, 20% of Russians will be over 65 by 2050, says the UN.President Putin has just signed a new bill on pension spending, envisaging a deficit of more than 265bn roubles (£3.1bn; $4.2bn) in 2018. That's 1.6% of the entire state budget expenditure.It is clearly not a sustainable situation, especially in tough economic times.",

            "title": "Letter from Africa: Should Ghanaian women be limited to three babies?",
            "content": "In our series of letters from African journalists, Elizabeth Ohene considers the controversial proposal to limit women to having three babies in Ghana.Among the Ga, the people who are indigenous to Ghana's capital, Accra, a woman is entitled to a live sheep on the delivery of her 10th child. The word for it is \"nyongmato\". I am not making this up even though it does sound like the kind of apocryphal story that is regularly made up. Lots of very important people among the Gas can testify to this. Unfortunately, I have not met any woman who has actually got a live sheep for having given birth to 10 children. Indeed, I have never met any woman who has had 10 children. I don't know if I have been moving in the wrong circles, because I don't even know any woman who has had five children. OK, as soon as I wrote that, I realised I was wrong. Two months ago, I went to the funeral of a female relation of mine who was my classmate in primary school. At her death, this relation of mine had 46 direct descendants; made up of eight children, 26 grandchildren and counting, and 10 great-grandchildren and counting. I was scandalised and I spent the entire funeral going over these figures and moaning to myself how easy it was to find the reasons for the poverty in Ghana. I have been waging a lonely unpopular battle about the rate of population growth in our country and against women having so many babies, but to no avail. I roll out what I consider to be a sound argument that I thought would win over all doubters. I cite Norway, which had a population of 3.5 million to Ghana's five million at the time of our independence in 1957.Today, there are 5.3 million people living in Norway while Ghana has a population of nearly 30 million.I make the argument that even if none of our rulers ever stole any public funds, we would still have economic difficulties at this rate of population growth. The last time I visited Lillehammer in Norway, I wrote in my column about the difference in our two situations. I pointed out it is no wonder everything is bursting at the seams and we are forever worrying about the lack of classrooms. Somehow, these arguments don't cut any ice with people here because it is considered in extremely bad taste to complain about the number of children somebody has. As someone once claimed to me: \"In our tradition we don't count children.\"  Elizabeth Ohene:\"Dr Appiah is an exceptionally brave woman. She has proposed that women should be restricted to having three children\"The good news is that now I don't feel alone in this battle. Into the fray has jumped the Executive Director of the National Population Council, Dr Leticia Adelaide Appiah, and believe me, she is an exceptionally brave woman. She is not speaking in parables, she is straight to the point. She has proposed that women should be restricted to having three children. And she says this should be obligatory. If a woman goes beyond this sacred number of three, she would be punished by being denied access to free government services.We have to talk about the quality of life, Dr Appiah has been arguing. I don't recall that anyone in an official position has been this categorical in Ghana about family planning ever before. We have had a family planning policy since 1970 but usually people only talk about the spacing of births and then hope that the spacing will lead to the birth of fewer children. This time around Dr Appiah is urging a cap on the number of children a woman should have.  It is interesting to note that that the people who claim to be outraged by the proposal to limit the number of children have been largely men. I'm sorry none of their arguments stick in my mind long enough to repeat here. I have not yet heard any woman complain that they don't want the number of children they can have to be restricted. Ghana's fertility rate, that is the average number of children per woman, currently stands at four, though that figure has fallen steadily over the last 30 years.Another interesting statistic worth noting is that there has not been a single death from measles in Ghana since 2002. Measles used to be one of the main infant killers, and the main justification for having many births. This past week, I have been doing a very unscientific survey. Every pregnant woman I have seen, I have asked which number it was and I have not yet met a woman in her third pregnancy. But I am probably looking in the wrong place by asking working women in banks, in offices and shops; the high birth rates can be found mostly in the rural areas. There might yet be some women who are aspiring to get that live sheep. We would probably have to find an equally attractive present for every woman who decides to stop at three or below. The problem is I can't think what can possibly challenge the \"10-baby sheep\", nyongmato.

            "title": "Pope Francis faces twin battle in Church split over sexual abuse",
            "content": "The crowds are quieter than they used to be. At the Pope's weekly audience in St Peter's Square, tourists and pilgrims barely filled half the piazza. It was easy to get to the front of the crowd to watch Francis go by in his Popemobile. In his address, he reflected on his recent trip to Ireland. \"The meeting with eight survivors [of abuse by priests] left a deep impact,\" he said.  The audience was a sombre reminder that the novelty of this papacy has given way to two main battles, which are now tangled into one. The first of these battles puts the Pope up against those who accuse him of not doing enough to tackle child abuse in the Church. Francis's opponents are an ad hoc coalition of abuse survivors, angry Catholics, and secular leaders who believe that the Church has too much unchecked power. The second battle sees the Pope fighting conservative Catholic critics who accuse him of diluting their faith. These critics began their fight shortly after Francis was elected in 2013. In particular, they object to his moves to allow divorced and remarried Catholics to take Communion. They are now adopting the subject of the first battle - child abuse - as a new front in their own long offensive. The two battles come together in the 11-page statement released by Archbishop Carlo Maria Vigano on 26 August.In the statement, the archbishop accused the Pope of failing to act in 2013 on allegations that Cardinal Theodore McCarrick had abused minors. The Pope's supporters vehemently question the credibility of this accusation. The archbishop's letter also made broader, conservative attacks on the way the Church is run.  \"The homosexual networks present in the Church must be eradicated,\" Archbishop Vigano wrote. \"These homosexual networks… act under the concealment of secrecy and lie with the power of octopus tentacles, and strangle innocent victims and priestly vocations, and are strangling the entire Church.\" To some Vatican-watchers, these accusations sound familiar. \"At the heart of it all is this animus against the Pope,\" says Robert Mickens, English-language editor of La Croix International.\"Vigano is kind of a strange character in this case because it's really a whole group of people. What is the motive behind this? To bring down Pope Francis in any way possible. They're trying to catch him in a trap. And Francis is not falling for it.\" But another group of conservative journalists in Rome gives voice to much of the dissatisfaction with Pope Francis. Edward Pentin, from the National Catholic Register, published the Vigano statement. He denies being part of an orchestrated campaign to bring down the Pope. \"I don't think there's any such organised campaign, but there has long been a growing and deep sense of concern and even anger about this pontificate among many practising Catholics,\" he says.\"They are particularly frustrated because they are trying to uphold the Church's teaching and morals but are not feeling well served by the Pope and much of the hierarchy.\"They sense this especially now, with questionable innovative teachings coming from the Vatican and reports of abuse cover up at the highest levels. I believe these Catholics' voices should be heard, and, as a Catholic journalist, I see it as my job to try to make sure they are.\" Those voices include a number of cardinals. In 2016, four of them wrote to Francis calling on him to clarify his teaching. It was seen as a highly unusual act of protest or even disobedience. Their letter, openly questioning the Pope's judgement, foreshadowed the statement released by Archbishop Vigano. Francis did not reply to the cardinals' letter. Nor has he replied to Carlo Maria Vigano's accusations.The Pope has clearly decided that there is nothing to be gained by engaging in open battle with conservative critics.  \"He is no pushover,\" says Robert Mickens. \"He is standing his ground.\"Popes can expect to find themselves taking on dissident factions within the Church. In 1988, Pope John Paul II took the dramatic step of excommunicating some members of a renegade religious society led by the French Archbishop Marcel Lefebvre which had rejected Vatican reforms. Benedict XVI took a strict line against priests who strayed from official teaching.  The fight against doctrinal opponents may be the easier of Francis's two battles. The Pope's wider public fight to convince the other critics inside and outside the Church that he is capable of confronting the institution's legacy of clerical sexual abuse may be much more difficult.

            "content": "Ugandan pop star and MP Bobi Wine has arrived in the US for medical treatment following accusations he was tortured and beaten while in military custody.The former rapper was initially prevented from leaving the country but was cleared to fly out on Friday.He, and 32 opposition politicians, were charged with treason last week over the alleged stoning of President Yoweri Museveni's convoy.Bobi Wine was later granted bail. The army denies allegations of torture. On Friday, police confirmed that Bobi Wine had been cleared to fly out of the country for specialised treatment after the government sent a team of nine doctors to examine him.His lawyer, Robert Amsterdam, said the pop star had also been violently re-arrested at the airport on Thursday \"even though the judge had let him have his passport because he needed to leave the country for medical reasons\". A police spokesman had confirmed on Twitter that Bobi Wine was being given a medical examination because of the allegations of torture.Police said that another opposition MP, Francis Zaake, who was also trying to go abroad for treatment, had been \"trying to flee the country and accordingly apprehended him\".On Friday, supporters of Bobi Wine held protests in the capital, Kampala. Pictures shared on social media showed plumes of smoke rising in the streets, with local media reporting that the protests were confined to Kamwokya slum, where the MP grew up. Security deploys in Kamwokya slum where residents were earlier protesting the re-arrest of Hon. Kyagulanyi also known as Bobi Wine \"The Ghetto President\". Bobi wine was last night blocked from traveling abroad for further treatment. #NTVNews https://t.co/3MaCh0unQp pic.twitter.com/hT67Qc1plOEnd of Twitter post  by @ntvugandaOn Monday Bobi Wine, whose real name is Robert Kyagulanyi, appeared on crutches during a court appearance. His allies say he was tortured by elite presidential guards during his detention. The army have described the allegations as \"rubbish\".His aides say he was later re-arrested at Uganda's main international airport where he was planning to board a plane to Washington for further medical treatment.\"He's in tremendous pain and suffered very serious injuries,\" Mr Amsterdam had said of the star's condition. \"There's not a part of his body that isn't in pain.\"\"His children were going to stay in Uganda. It was a brief trip, simply for a medical evaluation,\" he added.Before being arrested, Bobi Wine tweeted a gruesome picture of his driver, who he said had been shot dead by police thinking he was the MP. Bobi Wine was arrested on 13 August after a campaign rally in the north-western town of Arua where the presidential convoy was allegedly stoned.The 36-year-old musician was initially to be tried in a military court over accusations of unlawful possession of firearms but the charge was dropped. A civilian court later charged him with treason.Bobi Wine, and the other accused, were expected to appear in court again on Thursday but the hearing has been adjourned to 1 October.The Afrobeats star has been a thorn in the side of Mr Museveni's government. Since his election as an MP just over a year ago, he has backed candidates in three by-elections who have beaten those from the ruling National Resistance Movement (NRM), including in Arua.He was also a leading campaigner against the move to scrap the presidential age limit - set at 75 - which would have locked out the 74-year-old Mr Museveni's bid to run for a sixth term in 2021.Wine also joined local activists in July to protest against a social media tax introduced ostensibly to boost state revenue and to end what Mr Museveni called \"gossip\" on WhatsApp, Facebook and Twitter.Critics, however, said the 200 Uganda shillings ($0.05, £0.04) daily tax was meant to suppress dissenting voices.The government has since said it will review the tax.",

            "title": "Why McCain picked these 15 pallbearers",
            "content": "One of the bittersweet benefits of knowing one's life is coming to an end is the ability to make plans for how one will be memorialised. Senator John McCain reportedly took to the task with his trademark gusto, holding weekly meetings to arrange the details of his funeral and accompanying events.\"By the time he died on Saturday, Mr McCain had carefully stage-managed a four-day celebration of his life - but what was also an unmistakable rebuke to President Trump and his agenda,\" write Mike Shear and Katie Rogers in the New York Times. This included reaching out to those McCain wanted as pallbearers - a process he started in April. A total of 14 men and one woman will accompany the late senator's coffin into the National Cathedral in Washington DC on Saturday. The officially released list - which identifies them all as \"friends\" before offering further details - is fraught with meaning. Why on earth did McCain pick Warren Beatty, long a fixture among the liberal Hollywood elite, for this place of honour? It turns out the two had a friendship dating back to the 1990s. While they differed on many political subjects, the Oscar-winning Hollywood actor and the Arizona senator viewed campaign finance reform that would limit the corrupting influence of money on politics as a top policy priority. \"I've known John McCain for a long time,\" Beatty said in a 2008 interview with the Atlantic. \"He is a conservative.\"I think I've made it clear that I'm a liberal Democrat,\" Beatty continued. \"I don't think that political ideology is necessarily germane to friendships.\"It's been billed as McCain's \"final dig\" at Russian President Vladimir Putin - and Donald Trump. By selecting Russian opposition politician Vladimir Kara-Murza, McCain re-emphasised his repeated criticisms of the Putin regime and what he viewed as Mr Trump's too-cosy attitude toward it.McCain and Kara-Murza's friendship dates back to 2010 and the Arizona senator's support of Russian pro-democracy demonstrations. The two would later co-operate in marshalling support in Congress for Russian sanctions measures.Kara-Murza has twice been the target of apparent poison-based assassination attempts, the most recent, in February 2017, left him in a coma.\"Much has and will be written about McCain's military courage, his patriotism, his famed bipartisanship and his unimpeachable personal decency,\" Kara-Murza writes in a Washington Post tribute to the senator. \"His long-standing position on Russia deserves a special tribute.\"Two ex-presidents, Democrat Barack Obama and Republican George W Bush, will deliver eulogies for McCain, and the cast of officeholders among his pallbearers reinforces the bipartisan theme.Vice-President Joe Biden, a former Senate colleague, will also give a eulogy for McCain at services in Phoenix. Another Democrat, former Senator Russ Feingold, co-sponsored McCain's signature legislative achievement, the Bipartisan Campaign Reform Act of 2002 - which the two passed over the determined opposition of the chamber's Republican leadership.There are also several politicians who blurred traditional party lines - Republican-turned-independent former New York City Mayor Michael Bloomberg and William Cohen, a Republican senator who served in as secretary of defence in the Clinton administration.Like McCain, former Senator Gary Hart of Colorado once ran his own nearly successful insurgent presidential primary campaign, against Democrat Walter Mondale in 1984. Senator Sheldon Whitehouse of Rhode Island (the only current office-holder), former Texas Senator Phil Gramm and former Secretary of Homeland Security Tom Ridge round out the group. As with many politicians - at least, the good ones - McCain had a retinue of loyal aides and staffers who stuck with him for years. Mark Salter, McCain's former senate chief of staff, was also his top speechwriter and muse, co-writing seven books, including the 1999 best-seller about his family's military legacy and his time as a prisoner of war, Faith of My Fathers.Rick Davis, who took centre stage earlier this week when he read McCain's final words to the nation, served as the senator's campaign manager for both his 2000 and 2008 presidential bids.   As McCain knew as well as any public official, money is the fuel that powers a career in politics. He made campaign finance reform one of his life-long efforts, and perhaps his most prominent legislative achievements. Lofty principles, however, don't pay the campaign bills. Among the lesser-known pallbearers on Saturday are the people McCain relied on to bankroll his political ambitions.Fred Smith, founder of global delivery company Federal Express, served as national co-chair of McCain's 2008 presidential bid. Carla Eudy, a family friend and the only woman among the pallbearers, was McCain's 2008 national finance director and headed a McCain-affiliated political action committee. Rounding out the list is California communications executive Stephen Dart, a long-time Republican donor who also served as a fund-raiser for McCain's 2008 campaign.",

            "title": "Uganda's Bobi Wine crisis: The president and the pop star",
            "content": "Uganda's President Yoweri Museveni seems to be worried about the popularity of musician-turned-politician Bobi Wine.Not long after I arrive at the recording studio of the Afrobeats star, a pick-up truck with soldiers pulls up. Bobi Wine was charged this week with treason - and tension is high in Kamwokya, a slum where he grew up in the capital, Kampala.But is the 36-year-old, affectionately known as the \"ghetto president\", really a threat to Mr Museveni's three-decade rule?The show of force indicates the authorities are taking no chances.The officers file past a wall mural of Bobi Wine as they march into Kamwokya, past a small shop belonging to 26-year-old Idd Kibirige.He sells everything from music downloads, DVDs, phone chargers and power banks, things any self-respecting millennial would not be without. Outside speakers blare out Bobi Wine's biggest hits.\"We're playing him because he is in prison,\" Mr Kibirige says.Bobi Wine, whose real name is Robert Kyagulani, started his music career here more than 15 years ago. When he recently turned to politics, he won a seat in parliament by a landslide in a June 2017 by-election.Since then he has gone on to campaign for several parliamentary candidates who won seats from President Museveni's National Resistance Movement (NRM).The tension in Kampala stems from a bitterly fought by-election in the north-western town of Arua earlier this month which saw Bobi Wine and the president campaign for rival candidates.Bobi Wine's driver was found shot dead in a car. The police allege he was hit by a stray bullet as officers fought opposition crowds who were throwing stones at Mr Museveni's motorcade. The facts are still disputed but the pop star is now charged with treason, alongside 32 others. The political Afrobeats starSoldiers are accused of torturing him whilst in detention - a charge the authorities deny. When he appeared in court, he was unable to walk or stand by himself. Treason attracts the death penalty, although Uganda has not executed anyone since 2005. And they may not be convicted - veteran opposition leader Kizza Besigye has faced a treason charge and been freed, and is currently on bail following another charge of treason in 2016.For many in Kamwokya, Bobi Wine's whirlwind political career, as well as his socially conscious music, are inspiring.\"We want him because now he is our voice,\" says Mr Kibirige, who started his business after failing to find a job despite having a degree.\"[We want] Bobi Wine to be the next president.\" Uganda's politics today is not just about power but demographics and access to opportunities. More than three-quarters of Uganda's 35.6 million people are below the age of 30.Although data varies, youth unemployment is high. Some like the charity Action Aid puts it at 62% while the African Development Bank says it is 83%.These people are Bobi Wine's support base.President Museveni, 74, has not been watching from the sidelines. Despite championing a social media tax, he has used Facebook to reach out to young Ugandans and address their anger over Bobi Wine's detention.In the process, he has angered some by referring to young people as \"bazukulu\", meaning grandchildren - further highlighting the gap in age and possibly perception of much of the electorate.In one of his latest lengthy posts, the president defended his record on job creation, and criticised those who \"cynically\" lured the youth to protest.\"Our unemployed youth are a problem but a good one given that we have already laid the basis for resolving unemployment,\" he wrote.But Fred Muhumuza, an economist who used to work at Uganda's finance ministry, believes Mr Museveni is running out of time.You cannot make a promise to 20-year-old and the make him wait 10 years, he says.\"At 30 if he has not seen the promise come true, he becomes jittery. [Young people] become nervous for all the right reasons,\" he adds.The weakness of Uganda's opposition parties has also helped Bobi Wine's rise.They have often been criticised for not working together and lacking strong ideas on how to govern.In recent months the biggest of these, the Forum for Democratic Change (FDC), has been wracked by bitter and public infighting.And some political commentators say Bobi Wine's emergence could spell the beginning of the end for Mr Besigye, who has been Uganda's most high-profile opposition figure for many years.He has been the FDC's candidate against Mr Museveni in the last four elections - and some feel he needs to make way for others to challenge the 74-year-old president.More on Uganda:But Mr Besigye says to suggest that he feels threatened by Bobi Wine just creates divisions.\"[It's not about] Besigye and Museveni, Bobi Wine and Museveni or even Bobi Wine and Besigye,\" he told the BBC.\"This is the contestation of the people of Uganda for their liberation.\"Mr Besigye, who has suffered harassment, arrests and months in detention over many years, has some advice for Bobi Wine.\"It has to be understood that a struggle has a cost. Every struggle has a cost and every liberation has a cost and that cost must be borne by some people. And I don't regret doing my small bit.\"Despite the events of the last week, some in the ruling party are dismissive of Bobi Wine.\"If you want to gauge his support politically, let him stand for president. Otherwise the fact that people may sympathise does not mean they support you,\" says Moses Byaruhanga, the senior presidential adviser on political affairs.And despite the hopes of Mr Kibirige and Bobi Wine's other supporters, the pop star has not declared any ambitions to run for president.Ugandans will give you a list of other young charismatic opposition leaders whose political rise has been cut short, so there is no guarantee that Bobi Wine will survive this hurdle.Nevertheless, his emergence as a potent political figure has highlighted how the next election in 2021 is likely to be fought and won - winning the hearts and minds of young, frustrated Ugandans.",

            "title": "Chemnitz protests: Far right on march in east Germany",
            "content": "On an overcast afternoon, small candles flicker on the paving stones where, in the early hours of Sunday morning, a German carpenter in his thirties was fatally stabbed in a street fight. Even now, complete strangers arrive to lay flowers, stand in silence, hold hands. This growing makeshift memorial has become a focus for this troubled city's grief and anger.Little is known about how or why the brawl started. Police have dismissed rumours circulating online that the man was defending a woman from sexual assault. But within hours of his death in hospital, news that his killers were suspected to have been a Syrian and an Iraqi man triggered a furious and violent reaction.For two nights running, hundreds and then thousands of right-wing extremists and sympathisers have taken to the streets.The police openly admit they have been caught on the back foot both by the number of protesters and the speed at which they have mobilised. The groups behind the demonstrations have used social media to bring people together quickly. On Monday night in particular, organisers were able to galvanise supporters from all over the country. The seemingly spontaneous outbreak of violent xenophobia has shocked many in Germany.Pictures of demonstrators openly using the Nazi salute - a criminal offence in Germany - chasing and attacking people of foreign appearance and flinging bottles and fireworks have horrified many Germans, for whom the legacy of World War Two is a lasting belief that this country bears a special responsibility to fight any form of fascism.But many are not surprised. Right-wing sentiment and extremism have tended to find more fertile ground in Germany's former east - fuelled, some argue, by the social and economic inequality that followed reunification.  Associated violence was much higher last year for example in this part of the country than the west. The head of Saxony's intelligence services, Gordian Meyer-Plath, has said there is an organised scene in Chemnitz that includes right-wing hooligan structures such as the \"NS boys\" or \"Kaotik Chemnitz\" - organised around their support for the local football club. Both groups took part in the weekend's demonstrations.  The intelligence services reckon there were just over 23,000 right-wing extremists in Germany in 2016. German authorities have now vowed to intensify their efforts in the fight against them.But people who would describe themselves as ordinary citizens joined the demonstrations in Chemnitz, too. Since 2015, when hundreds of thousands of people sought asylum in Germany, anti-migrant sentiment has manifested much more strongly in the old east. Anti-migrant grassroots movement Pegida harnessed public concern in Saxony with weekly marches in Dresden, which at their height attracted 20,000 people.Some were extremists. But all marched together, chanting the old Nazi slogan \"Lügenpresse\" (lying press).Pegida also encouraged demonstrations in Chemnitz at the weekend, but it is no longer the force it was. Hard on its heels came the far-right Alternative for Germany (AfD) party. Saxony may have encountered relatively few asylum seekers. But it is a stronghold for the anti-migrant party which national polls suggest is also on its way to becoming the country's second largest party. The pictures from Chemnitz - the rage, the sorrow, the violence - suggest a Germany aflame with resistance to migration. There is much evidence to the contrary.The number of people seeking asylum has fallen steeply and there are integration success stories - one in four new arrivals has a job.A national poll recently found that Germans are now more concerned about health, pensions and climate policy. But migration remains a highly charged political theme. And, even as local politicians appeal for calm, Germany's establishment has yet to find a way to truly soothe the disquiet which roared into such violence at the weekend. ",

            "title": "Viewpoint: Ortega's Nicaragua crisis evokes memories of past",
            "content": "Javier Bauluz is a Pulitzer Prize-winning Spanish photojournalist who has been reporting on the recent wave of protests in Nicaragua in which hundreds of people have been killed. He argues that there are parallels between the current crisis and Nicaragua's armed conflict of the 1980s, which he also covered.\"How did we not realise that they were becoming monsters? How did we let them get away with so much?\" an old woman asked me, crying, at an anti-government demonstration in the Nicaraguan capital, Managua, at the end of April.The upset woman was a former member of the Sandinista rebel group, which successfully rose up against President Anastasio Somoza in 1979, thereby putting an end to more than 40 years of bloody rule by his family. Now, four decades on from the overthrow of Somoza, she was taking to the streets against the government of Daniel Ortega, himself a former rebel and Sandinista leader.After winning four presidential elections, Mr Ortega has been in power for more than 16 of the 39 years since Somoza was ousted.When the crying old woman said she regretted \"letting them get away with\", she was talking about the repression she saw coming from Mr Ortega's administration after the anti-government protests began on 18 April. When I landed in Managua on the fifth day of protests, the number of people killed stood at 27, according to figures from the Nicaraguan Association for Human Rights (ANPDH). According to that same organisation, that number had gone up to 448 by 26 July. A veteran of the fight against Somoza, Mr Ortega has failed to realise that there are new arms available to those fighting today's battles.The internet and social media have become both tools and weapons for those demonstrating against President Ortega.They are using them to organise protests and to document human rights violations carried out by his government.I think that Mr Ortega's thinking is stuck in the 1980s. He does not realise that having control of a large part of the traditional media, mostly owned by his sons, is no longer enough to control the flow of information. But there are things that remind me of what I experienced in Nicaragua of the 1980s: the strength, courage and determination, which I have seen among the young and those not so young (among those taking to the streets are also mothers, fathers and grandparents).These days, medical students are detained for treating peaceful protesters who do not have anywhere else to turn after being banned from seeking help in hospitals.These doctors and aspiring doctors have to act clandestinely. That reminds me of 1986 and 1987 when medical and other students in Managua would volunteer to harvest coffee in the north of the country.At that time, Daniel Ortega was in his first term in office and was fighting against the anti-Sandinista rebels, who emerged after Somoza was ousted. Coffee was practically Nicaragua's only source of income during the war against the Contra rebels. The Contras, on the other hand, enjoyed the backing of the US government to the tune of $100m, after President Ronald Reagan had labelled the Sandinista government a \"Communist regime\" and a \"terrorist\" state.The young peaceful protesters of today remind me of those students whom I met in the coffee plantations, carrying AK-47 rifles in one hand and baskets full of coffee beans in the other.The rifles were essential as the area came under constant attack by the Contras. One medical student, who went by the name of Nadia, always got up early in the mornings to lead the group to where they would harvest that day.With her rifle slung across her shoulder she would go first, knowingly running the risk of treading on one of the many mines that littered the countryside.  That courage and determination which I witnessed in the 1980s and that clever Nicaraguan sense of humour and joy of life which I admire so much, I have come across again at today's barricades - even when the bullets were flying over our heads.They have conquered fear, just like those students did in the 80s.The phrase that I have heard over and over again here in Nicaragua is: \"They're going, one way or another\".It refers to President Ortega and his wife Rosario Murillo, who is also the country's vice-president, and the protesters' aim to kick them out of office, if not the country.What remains to be seen is how long the couple will take to leave and how much more blood has to be shed before they do. President Ortega blames everything on the protesters and denies any responsibility. He has even gone as far as flatly denying the existence of pro-government paramilitary groups, when there are hundreds of videos and eyewitness reports which attest to their actions.He is committing the same mistake he did when he lost the 1990 presidential election by underestimating the strength of feeling among ordinary Nicaraguans. During that campaign, which I covered, everything had at first pointed to an Ortega win, as crowds would gather to cheer him and his vice-presidential candidate, Sergio Ramírez (who has since turned into a staunch opponent of Mr Ortega).But Mr Ortega's decision to keep military service obligatory resulted in thousands of mothers, who did not want to see their sons risk their lives, voting against the Sandinista leader. Today, you can find all kind of people at the protests, rich, poor, leftists, rightists, old, young, students and workers. Many of those manning the barricades are Sandinistas who believe that Daniel Ortega has betrayed the revolution and its ideals. It is not unusual to meet people who fought Somoza and the Contras at the anti-government marches. Many are there with their children and grandchildren. They draw a clear distinction between those who support the present government - whom they call Orteguistas after the president - and themselves, arguing that they are the ones who are upholding the ideals of the Sandinista revolution and the 20th-Century general, Augusto Sandino, from whom they drew inspiration and their name. Like the Sandinistas who fought Somoza in the the 70s and the Contras in the 80s, those fighting for their basic human rights today are paying a high price for their determination and perseverance. But they are not deterred and have even adopted the battle cry of Sandinista rebel Leonel Rugama, who when he was surrounded by Somoza's troops shouted: \"Let your mother surrender!\"While looking for the home of one of those killed in the recent protests to report on his funeral, I found myself remembering Nadia, the young student who walked among the coffee plants, ready to fight with her rifle, or step on to a landmine, all to defend her ideals of justice and liberty.\"Which side of the barricade would she be on now?\" I asked myself.

            "content": "A fire has gutted the National Museum of Brazil in Rio de Janeiro, the oldest scientific institution in the country.Most of the 20 million items it contained, including the oldest human remains ever found in the Americas, are believed to have been destroyed. The cause of the blaze is not known. No injuries have been reported.The museum, located in a building that once served as the residence for the Portuguese royal family, celebrated its 200th anniversary this year.The fire started on Sunday evening, after the facility had closed for the day. Aerial images broadcast on Brazilian television showed it spreading throughout the building.BREAKING: The National Museum of #Brazil in #Rio is completely consumed in fire. Founded in 1818, the museum is the holder of over 20 million items, including mummies, meteorites, insects, & fossils. So sad to see history in flames :(Video from @g1 live feed#museunacional pic.twitter.com/eCm8G6gKwAEnd of Twitter post  by @JustinFleenorBrazil's President Michel Temer said in a tweet that it was a \"sad day for all Brazilians\" as \"200 years of work, research and knowledge were lost\".Roberto Robadey, a spokesman for the Rio fire department, is quoted by the Associated Press news agency as saying that the hydrants closest to the museum were not working and that firefighters had to get water from a nearby lake.By Monday morning the fire was under control and some of the museum's pieces had been rescued, he added.By Katy Watson, BBC South America correspondentThis isn't just Brazilian history that's gone up in flames. Many see this as a metaphor for the city - and the country as a whole. Rio de Janeiro is in crisis. Growing violence, a deep economic decline and political corruption have combined to make the city a shadow of what it once was. It was only in 2016 that it was hosting the Olympic Games - an event into which Brazil poured billions of dollars. But the hangover from the sporting event has hit Rio hard. Add to that the fact that federal spending has been slashed, and with violence on the rise, tourism numbers have also declined.This was a museum that many saw as long ignored and underfunded - now, with devastating consequences for Brazil's heritage.It was one of the largest museums of natural history and anthropology in the Americas.Its millions of artefacts included fossils, Brazil's largest meteorite, dinosaur bones and a 12,000-year-old skeleton of a woman known as \"Luzia\", the oldest ever discovered in the Americas.The building was also home to items covering the centuries from the arrival of the Portuguese in the 1500s to the declaration of a republic in 1889.The ethnology collection had unique pieces from the pre-Columbian era and artifacts from indigenous cultures.Pieces from Greco-Roman times and Egypt were also on display at the museum.Portugal's royal family transferred the court to the building in 1808, when the country faced with the threat of invasion from Napoleon.The museum was established in 1818, with the aim of promoting scientific research by making its collection available to specialists. Marcelo Moreira - a journalist with TV Globo in Rio - told the BBC: \"It's very sad... This museum has a great history. It represents a lot for Brazilian history and Brazilian culture. It's really a big loss for Brazil.\"In an interview with Globo, the museum's director said it was a \"cultural tragedy\".One museum employee told the network that project managers had had \"tremendous difficulty\" trying to secure funding for \"sufficient\" resources for the palace. Another, librarian Edson Vargas da Silva, is quoted by local media describing the building, which he said had wooden floors and contained \"a lot of things that burn very fast\", such as paper documents. Employees had reportedly previously expressed concern about funding cuts and the dilapidated state of the premises.",

            "title": "Children 'attempting suicide' at Greek refugee camp",
            "content": "At Moria camp on the Greek island of Lesbos, there is deadly violence, overcrowding, appalling sanitary conditions and now a charity says children as young as 10 are attempting suicide. The Victoria Derbyshire programme has been given rare access inside.\"We are always ready to escape, 24 hours a day we have our children ready,\" says Sara Khan, originally from Afghanistan.\"The violence means our little ones don't get to sleep.\" Sara explains that her family spend all day queuing for food at the camp and all night ready to run - in fear of the fights that break out constantly.Conditions are so appalling that charities have actually left in protest. The place smells of raw sewage, and there are around 70 people per toilet, according to medical charity Medecins Sans Frontieres (MSF).Some people live in mobile cabins, but rammed in-between them all are tents and tarpaulin sheets - homes for those who cannot obtain any official living space.The camp is also now sprawling into surrounding countryside. One tent houses 17 people - four families under one canvas.There are currently more than 8,000 people crammed into Moria camp, which was supposed to house around 2,000.A mum describes faeces on the floor of the shelter that she lives in with her tiny 12-day-old baby.The violence in the camp is extreme. In May, hundreds of Kurdish people fled because of a huge battle largely between Arab and Kurdish men. Ali, who has now left the camp, says when he got to Moria with his family \"we found that there was already existing sectarianism and racism, whether it was between Sunnis and Shias, or Kurds, Arabs and Afghans\".He adds that conflict between rebel groups in Syria has also landed inside the gates of the refugee camp. \"It's like the war in Syria and even uglier. We heard about rape cases in there, sexual harassment,\" he says.Watch Catrin's film in full here.On the day we are filming at Moria, yet another fight breaks out in the lunch queue for food. Two people are stabbed - others suffer panic attacks witnessing it. Nearby medical workers are put on standby at MSF.The charity initially left the island in protest at conditions, but has now opened a clinic just outside the gates because the need was so great. The children they are treating have skin conditions caused by the poor hygiene inside, and respiratory diseases from tear gas fired into the camp by police to quell fights. Mental health problems are rife. The workers say they have had to deal with children as young as 10 attempting suicide. \"It's something we're seeing constantly,\" says Luca Fontana, Lesbos co-ordinator for MSF, adding that they are reporting the conditions to the UN refugee agency UNHCR and Greece's ministry of health.\"Despite the fact that we push to move these children to Athens, as soon as possible, it's not happening. Those children are still here.\"The camp opened in 2015 and was initially designed as a transit post for people to stay for a matter of days - but some have been here for years. It is controlled by the Greek government, and the overcrowding is because Greece is enforcing the EU's \"containment\" policy, keeping people on the island rather than transferring them to the Greek mainland.It is part of the EU-Turkey deal which aims to return thousands of refugees to Turkey, and it has been in force since March 2016. From then to July 2018, according to EU figures, 71,645 new refugees arrived in Greece by sea and only 2,224 have been returned to Turkey.George Matthaiou, a Greek government press representative on Moria, concedes conditions are terrible, but blames the EU rather than Greece. \"We don't have the money. You know the situation of Greece, economically,\" he says.\"I want to help but I can do nothing, because the European Union closed the borders.\"Back at the MSF tent, Luca Fontana, who has worked all over the world in conflict zones, says the camp is the worst place he has seen in his life. He worked during the Ebola outbreaks in West Africa but says, \"I've never seen the level of suffering we are witnessing here every day\".\"Even those affected by Ebola still have the hope to survive or they have the support of their family, their society, their village, their relatives.\"Here, the hope is taken away by the system.\"Additional reporting by Leo Sands.Watch the BBC's Victoria Derbyshire programme on weekdays between 09:00 and 11:00 BST on BBC Two and the BBC News Channel in the UK and on iPlayer afterwards.",

            "content": "Israel's public broadcaster has apologised to listeners after music by Richard Wagner was played on the radio. The 19th-Century German composer remains controversial in the country because of his virulent anti-Semitism and because Hitler was a great fan.But on Friday a leading classical music station played part of Wagner's Götterdämmerung (Twilight of the Gods).In its apology, the broadcaster said the editor had erred in his \"artistic choice\" and Wagner would not be played.The Israeli Public Broadcasting Corporation added that it recognised the pain such a broadcast would cause among Holocaust survivors.Wagner's work contains views on racial purity. The composer was also the author of a pamphlet entitled Judaism in Music, in which he said that he said that \"the Jew\" was \"incapable of artistic expression\".Wagner's music is not banned in Israel but is not played due to widespread public opposition. On Friday the presenter on the Kol Hamusica station played a recording of the final act of Götterdämmerung. The piece was directed by Daniel Barenboim - who is Jewish - and performed at the Bayreuth Festival, which celebrates Wagner, in 1991.The subsequent apology was criticised by those who argue that his abhorrent views do not invalidate his work.\"There are just as many Holocaust survivors who love the music as there are those who object to it. You have to listen to his music and his music is absolutely beautiful,\" said Jonathan Livny, head of the Israel Wagner Society.In 2011 an Israeli orchestra played a Wagner composition in Germany. At the time, Israeli Chamber Orchestra Conductor Roberto Paternostro said that while Wagner's ideology was \"terrible\", the aim was \"to divide the man from his art\".",

            "title": "Rohingya crisis: Seeing through the official story in Myanmar",
            "content": "The 300,000 people who have fled Rakhine state to Bangladesh over the past two weeks all come from the northern districts of Maungdaw, Buthidaung and Rathedaung, the last areas of Myanmar with sizeable Rohingya populations not confined to displacement camps. These districts are hard to reach. Roads are poor, and the government requires permits to go there, which journalists rarely get.So we grabbed the opportunity to join a government-organised visit to Maungdaw, for 18 local and foreign journalists. It would mean seeing only places and people they wanted us to see. But sometimes, even under these restrictions, you can glean valuable insights. Besides, the government has arguments that need to be heard. It is now facing an armed insurgency, albeit one some would argue has been self-inflicted. The communal conflict in Rakhine state has a long history, and would be difficult for any government to deal with.On arrival at Sittwe, the Rakhine state capital, we were given instructions. No-one was to leave the group and try to work independently. There was a curfew at 6pm, so no wandering after dark. We could request to go to places that interested us; in practice we found such requests were rejected on grounds of security. To be fair, I believe they were genuinely concerned for our safety.Most of the travel in this low-lying region of Myanmar is along the maze of creeks and rivers on crowded boats. The journey from Sittwe to Buthidaung takes six hours. From there we travelled for an hour on a rough road over the Mayu Hills to Maungdaw. As we drove into the town we passed our first burned village, Myo Thu Gyi. Even the palm trees were scorched.The government's purpose in bringing us was to balance the overwhelmingly negative narrative coming from the Rohingya refugees arriving in Bangladesh, who have almost all spoken of a deliberate campaign of destruction by the Myanmar military and Rakhine mobs, and appalling human rights abuses.But right away these efforts faltered.We were first taken to a small school in Maungdaw, now crowded with displaced Hindu families. They all had the same story to tell of Muslims attacking, of fleeing in fear. Oddly, Hindus who have fled to Bangladesh all say they were attacked by local Rakhine Buddhists, because they resemble Rohingyas. In the school we were accompanied by armed police and officials. Could they speak freely? One man started to tell me how soldiers had been firing at his village, and he was quickly corrected by a neighbour.A woman in an orange, lacy blouse and distinctive grey and mauve longyi was especially animated about the abuses by Muslims.We were then taken to a Buddhist temple, where a monk described Muslims burning down their own homes, nearby. We were given photographs catching them in the act. They looked strange.Men in white haji caps posed as they set light to the palm-thatch roof. Women wearing what appeared to be lacy tablecloths on their heads melodramatically waved swords and machetes. Later I found that one of the women was in fact the animated Hindu woman from the school, and I saw that one of the men had also been present in among the displaced Hindu. They had faked the photos to make it look as though Muslims were doing the burning. We had an audience with Colonel Phone Tint, the local minister for border security. He described how Bengali terrorists, as they call the militants of the Arakan Rohingya Salvation Army, had taken control of Rohingya villages, and forced them to offer one man per household as a fighter. Those who refused to comply have their houses burned, he said. He accused the militants of planting mines and destroying three bridges.I asked whether he was saying that all of the dozens of burned villages had been destroyed by the militants. He confirmed that was the government's position. Responding to a question about military atrocities, he waved it away. \"Where is the proof?\" he asked.  \"Look at those women,\" he meant the Rohingya refugees, \"who are making these claims - would anyone want to rape them?\"The few Muslims we were able to see in Maungdaw were mostly too scared to talk in front of a camera. Breaking away from our minders, we spoke to some who described the hardship of not being allowed to leave their neighbourhood by the security forces, of food shortages, and intense fear.One young man said they had wanted to flee to Bangladesh, but their leaders had signed an agreement with the authorities to stay. In the now quiet Bengali market, I asked a man what he was frightened of. The government, he said.The main destination on our itinerary outside Maungdaw was the coastal town of Alel Than Kyaw. This was one of the places attacked by Arsa militants in the early hours of 25 August. As we approached, we passed village after village, all completely empty. We saw boats, apparently abandoned, along with goats and cattle. There were no people.Alel Than Kyaw had been razed to the ground. Even the clinic, with a sign showing it had been run by the charity Medecins Sans Frontieres, had been destroyed. To the north, in the distance we could see four columns of smoke rising, and heard bursts of automatic weapons fire. More villages being put to the torch, we guessed. Police Lieutenant Aung Kyaw Moe described to us how he had been given advance warning of the attack. He had taken the non-Muslim population for protection into his barracks, and his men fought off the assailants - armed, he said, with guns, swords and home-made explosives, for three hours until they were driven off. Seventeen of the militants lay dead, and one immigration officer. The Muslim population fled shortly afterwards.But he struggled to explain why parts of the town were still smouldering, two weeks after the attack, and in the rainy season. Perhaps a few Muslims stayed on, and then set their homes alight before leaving more recently, he suggested half-heartedly.Then, on our way back from Alel Than Kyaw, something entirely unplanned happened.We spotted black smoke billowing out of some trees, over the rice fields. It was another village going up, right by the road. And the fires had only just started. We all shouted at our police escort to stop the van. When they did, we just ran, leaving our bewildered government minder behind. The police came with us, but then declared it was unsafe to enter the village. So we went ahead of them.The sound of burning and crackling was everywhere. Women's clothing, clearly Muslim, was strewn on the muddy path. And there were muscular young men, holding swords and machetes, standing on the path, baffled by the sight of 18 sweaty journalists rushing towards them. They tried to avoid being filmed, and two of them dashed further into the village, bringing out the last of their group and making a hasty exit.They said they were Rakhine Buddhists. One of my colleagues managed a quick conversation with one of them, who admitted they had set the houses on fire, with the help of the police.As we walked in, we could see the roof of the madrassa had just been set alight. School texts with Arabic script had been thrown outside. An empty plastic jug, reeking of petrol, had been left on the path.The village was called Gawdu Thar Ya. It was a Muslim village. There was no sign of the inhabitants. The Rakhine men who had torched the village walked out, past our police escort, some carrying household items they had looted. The burning took place close to a number of large police barracks. No-one did anything to stop it.",

            "title": "How Libya holds the key to solving Europe's migration crisis",
            "content": "The European Union wants to set up migrant \"reception centres\" in North Africa to process the thousands of Africans trying to reach Europe. This has been rejected by Libya, where people-smuggling networks once controlled by former strongman Muammar Gaddafi, are now able to operate freely, writes the BBC's Farouk Chothia.  As he appealed to Nato not to launch air strikes to overthrow his regime, then-Libyan leader Muammar Gaddafi said: \"Now listen, you people of Nato. You're bombing a wall which stood in the way of African migration to Europe and in the way of al-Qaeda terrorists. This wall was Libya. You're breaking it.\"Gaddafi was trying to exploit European fears about migration in the hope of clinging to power, but it did not work. He was killed by Nato-backed militias in October 2011 following a popular uprising against his 42-year rule. As a result, Europe - especially Italy - lost a key partner in efforts to reduce migration from Africa. \"Not enough attention was paid to Libya after Gaddafi's overthrow,\" Tarek Megersi, a Libyan analyst with the UK-based European Council on Foreign Relations think-tank, told the BBC. \"There is a lack of governance structures and smuggling groups have exploited this to the maximum,\" Mr Megersi added. Unlike Turkey which has stemmed the flow of migrants by agreeing to take back Syrians who reach the Greek islands in exchange for a huge financial package, Libya's weak internationally recognised government has rejected a European Union proposal to set up \"reception centres\" for African migrants while European states consider their asylum applications.'We categorically reject camps for migrants,'' Libya's Deputy Prime Minister Ahmed Maiteeq said, following talks with Italy's far-right interior minister Matteo Salvini in Tripoli last week. ''It is not allowed by Libyan law,\" he added.A further complication is the breakdown in law and order in Libya, where a host of rival militias are largely able to operate as they please, with some making huge amounts of money from the migrant trade.Mr Megersi said migrants have rapidly changed the demographics of parts of Libya. The coastal city of Zawiya, which used to have a population of about 200,000, now has more than one million migrants living in it, and the surrounding area. \"They [Libyans] have the same fear as European states,\" he added.Speaking after an African Union (AU) summit in Mauritania on Monday, Morocco's Foreign Minister Nasser Bourita also rejected the EU proposal, describing it as \"an easy, counter-productive solution\", although some poor states along the migration route - Niger is rumoured to be one of them - might eventually agree to host the \"reception centres\". Gaddafi signed a \"friendship\" agreement with then-Italian Prime Minister Silvio Berlusconi in August 2008, in a deal which saw his regime tightening border controls - including joint maritime patrols - in exchange for Italy pledging $5bn (£3.75bn) in compensation for colonial-era crimes. The deal led to a sharp decline in the number of people trying to reach Europe by boat -  from nearly 40,000 in 2008 to 3,200 in the first seven months after joint patrols started in 2009, according to EU-funded research.In total, 206,880 people left Libyan shores between 2003 and 2012, an average of about 23,000 a year. Almost all of them - 190,425 - went to the Italian island of Lampedusa and the remaining 16,445 to Malta, other research shows. Mr Megersi said Gaddafi used migration \"to hold Europe hostage\", allowing smuggling networks - made up of people from the two main ethnic groups in the south-west, the Tuareg and Tebu - to thrive when it suited him.\"The tribes of southern Libya have historically been smugglers because of a lack of economic opportunities and development,\" Mr Megersi told the BBC.\"Gaddafi made a deal with them - smuggle goods to Niger, Chad and Algeria, rather than people to Europe. He will give them petrol or flour at subsidised prices, which they will then sell at market prices.\"The vacuum left by Gaddafi was never filled by any entity capable of exerting control or pressure over them,\" Mr Megersi said. According to UN figures, about 15,151 people left North Africa - mainly Libya - by boat in 2012, which many Libyans described as the \"golden year\" after Gaddafi's overthrow. In 2014, the number rose to a staggering  170,110. This was because conflict escalated between rival governments and militias jostling for power following disputed elections. The fighting was so intense that the US shut its embassy and evacuated its diplomats to neighbouring Tunisia.In a report published last year following a study on migration trends, the UN High Commission for Refugees said: \"Libya has for decades drawn people from neighbouring countries, as it offered the best employment opportunities and highest salaries in the region - although it has been increasingly roiled by instability and insecurity since the ouster of Muammar Gaddafi in 2011.\"The study found that around half of those travelling to Libya do so believing they can find jobs there, but end up fleeing onwards to Europe to escape life-threatening dangers and difficult economic conditions plus widespread exploitation and abuse.\" Smuggling networks operating across East and West Africa bring the migrants by road to Libya, from countries as diverse as Eritrea - a small state which young people flee to avoid military conscription - and Nigeria, Africa's most populous state which is battling high levels of unemployment, an Islamist-led insurgency and clashes between herders and farmers.      Efforts to break up the networks in Libya and other states have yielded results.\"Certain militias [in Libya] have been given incentives to stop human-trafficking and have been co-opted into law-enforcement activities, but what these incentives are remains unclear,\" Mark Micallef, a Malta-based researcher with the Global Initiative Against Transnational Organised Crime think-tank, told the BBC. Sudan - led by Omar al-Bashir, who is wanted by the International Criminal Courts for war crimes in Darfur - has also cooperated with the EU.\"Over the past two years, Sudan has been cracking down on its northern border with Chad, Libya and Egypt,\" Mr Micallef said. \"It has taken the opportunity to come out of isolation and engage with the international community.\"Niger - which is second from bottom on the UN Human Development Index - has also \"played more than its part\", despite the \"very big hit\" this has had on the economy in its northern Agadez region, which was heavily dependent on migrants en route to Libya, Mr Micallef said.In exchange, the EU offered 610m euros (£540m; $714m) to Niger in 2016 from a fund set up to address what it calls the root causes of \"destabilisation, forced displacement and irregular migration\" in 26 African states. This included tackling population growth, \"extreme poverty\" and  weak \"economic infrastructure\", the EU said on its website.Significantly, the number of boat migrants has dropped in the first six months of this year. Less than 50,000 people arrived in Europe from North Africa, suggesting that if there is no major outbreak of violence in Libya ahead of elections scheduled for December, sea crossings in 2018 could be at their lowest since 2014.  More on the migration crisis: For its part, the AU decided at its summit to establish the African Observatory for Migration and Development in a bid to coordinate its response to the crisis.\"Africa should not just react to decisions taken outside. We should have our own narrative,\" Mr Bourita, Morocco's foreign minister, told the BBC.To curb migration, African states needed to invest in young people, who were \"an energy\", Mr Bourita said. \"Either you use it properly and it can be an element of development or you will not control it and it will be a problem for all the countries,\" he added. In a report published last month after a survey in nine African states, Afrobarometer, a South African-based non-governmental organisation, said the continent needed \"thriving\" economies to stem migration. The desire to migrate was strongest among the young and the educated, with 43% of respondents citing the need to find a job as the main reason and 33% saying they wanted to escape economic hardship and poverty, the report said. Most southern Africans preferred to settle in another African state, while those from West and east Africa preferred to go to Europe and North America, the report added. Mr Megersi believes that the EU should place greater emphasis on creating legal avenues for migration in order to boost its workforce. \"Some do it for asylum. Others for economic reasons. They are young men eager and willing to work in different spheres. Europe needs migration, with its ageing population,\" he said. But the current political climate in Europe mitigates against this, with many voters blaming migrants for their economic problems. This has led to the rise of right-wing parties - like Mr Salvini's League party in Italy - and efforts to curb migration are likely to intensify.\"Populists are gaining ground by holding a firm line, and you have one ad hoc measure after another. Migration policy in Europe is a game of politics,\" Mr Megersi added.",

            "title": "Myanmar Rohingya: How a 'genocide' was investigated",
            "content": "Indiscriminate killing; villages burned to the ground; children assaulted; women gang-raped - these are the findings of United Nations investigators who allege that \"the gravest crimes under international law\" were committed in Myanmar last August.Such was their severity, the report said, the army must be investigated for genocide against the Rohingya Muslims in the western Rakhine state.The investigators' conclusions came despite them not being granted access to Myanmar by the government there, which has since rejected the report.This is how the investigators came to their conclusions.On 24 March 2017, the UN Human Rights Council agreed to form an independent fact-finding mission on Myanmar to look into \"alleged recent human rights violations by military and security forces\".Five months after the mission was formed, Myanmar's army launched a major assault on Rakhine state, following deadly attacks by Rohingya militants on police posts.The military's campaign became the main focus of the investigation, which also looked into rights abuses in Kachin and Shan states.The mission wrote to Myanmar's government three times asking for access to the country. It received no response.\"The first rule was 'do no harm',\" says Christopher Sidoti, one of the three people who headed the investigation.\"Those people we spoke to had been heavily traumatised, and if our staff considered that an interview would be re-traumatising, it wouldn't have been conducted.\"No evidence is so important that it warrants re-traumatising someone who has gone through all these experiences.\"At least 725,000 people have fled Rakhine state over the past 12 months, many to neighbouring Bangladesh. As a result, despite not getting access to Myanmar, investigators were able to gather a vast amount of testimony from people who had experienced violence at first-hand before fleeing.They spoke to 875 people in Bangladesh, Malaysia, Thailand, Indonesia and the UK, and made a decision early on that the most valuable testimony would come from people who had not shared their stories before.\"We didn't want to interview people who had been interviewed by other organisations,\" Mr Sidoti, an Australian human rights law expert, says. \"We didn't want a situation where people's evidence could have been tainted.\"We tried to get people from a wide variety of areas and when we became more and more focused later on, we would deliberately, through a community network, seek out others from that area to get a better picture of what went on.\"\"We would never use just one account as proof,\" Mr Sidoti says. \"We always sought corroboration from primary and secondary sources.\"Those sources included videos, photographs, documents and satellite images, which showed the destruction of Rohingya villages over several months in 2017.In one case, investigators had received several reports from refugees in Cox's Bazar, Bangladesh, that a village had been destroyed in particular circumstances at a particular time.Investigators were then able to source satellite images that corroborated what witnesses had said.Satellites images showed that:Getting hold of photographic evidence from the ground proved to be more of a challenge.\"When people were leaving Rakhine state, they were being stopped, searched and deprived of their money, gold and mobile phones,\" Mr Sidoti says. \"It seemed pretty clear this was an attempt to get video or photographic evidence they had recorded.\"There wasn't much left but we made use of it.\"The report names six senior military figures it believes should go on trial, including Commander-in-Chief Min Aung Hlaing and his deputy.How were investigators able to point the finger directly at these men?The case here is not based on a paper trail, or a recording, but instead on research.Investigators relied heavily on others' detailed understanding of how Myanmar's government works. Among them was a military adviser who had co-operated with war crimes tribunals in the past.\"We have been able to access extraordinary international advice on various aspects of Myanmar's military,\" Mr Sidoti says. \"The conclusion we have come up with is that the army is so tightly controlled that nothing happens involving the army in Myanmar without the commander-in-chief and his deputies knowing.\"While the people believed to have given the orders have been named, work is ongoing to identify the members of the military who may have committed atrocities.\"We do have a list of alleged perpetrators on the ground and they will remain confidential for now,\" Mr Sidoti says. \"Their names have come up frequently enough for them to be put on lists to face more investigation.\"Identifying what appears to be genocide and proving that what happened fits the legal definition of genocide are two different things.\"Evidence of crimes against humanity was very quickly obtained and was quite overwhelming,\" Mr Sidoti says. \"Genocide is a much more legally complex issue.\"As the report states, genocide is when \"a person commits a prohibited act with the intent to destroy, in whole or in part, a national, ethnical, racial or religious group\".The key word is \"intent\". Investigators believe the evidence of that intent by the Myanmar army is clear.They cite statements by commanders and suspected perpetrators, and the degree of planning required to carry out such an operation. But still, identifying a genocide from a legal perspective took a significant amount of legal work.\"We arrived at a position we had not expected to be in when we were beginning,\" Mr Sidoti says. \"None of the three of us thought the evidence for genocide would be as strong as it was. That came as a surprise.\"The report says that the six military officials should face trial. It also condemns Myanmar's de facto leader, Nobel Peace Prize laureate Aung San Suu Kyi, for failing to intervene to stop attacks, and the UN's outgoing rights chief this week said she should have resigned as a result.The report also makes a series of recommendations, including the referral of the investigation to the International Criminal Court or to a new tribunal, and the imposition of an arms embargo.However, China has so far resisted strong action against its neighbour and ally Myanmar on the UN Security Council, where it holds a veto.Mr Sidoti acknowledges that officials in Myanmar are unlikely to investigate the allegations themselves. Last year, an internal investigation by the army exonerated itself of blame in the Rohingya crisis, and Myanmar's Permanent Representative to the UN last week told BBC Burmese the report was full of \"one-sided accusations against us\".\"We have made recommendations and it is up to others to act on them,\" Mr Sidoti says. \"I have a high expectation that the Security Council will act on its responsibilities. But I'm not naive.\"",

            "title": "Letter from Africa: How bruised is President Buhari by defections?",
            "content": "In our series of letters from African journalists, editor-in-chief of Nigeria's Daily Trust newspaper Mannir Dan Ali considers President Muhammadu Buhari's chances of re-election after the loss of key allies. The dramatic defections of nearly 50 legislators last week from Nigeria's ruling party looked for a moment like history was repeating itself. There had been hints for weeks that defections were on the cards.Key members of President Muhammadu Buhari's All Progressive Congress (APC) party, who were aggrieved by his leadership, wanted to deal a powerful body blow in the run-up to next year's polls. A similar strategy had weakened the People's Democratic Party (PDP) when it was in power, leading to its defeat in the 2015 elections.However, when the defections finally happened, they were not as seismic as in 2015 when five influential state governors and at least two political kingmakers opened the floodgates for others to follow. So far around four dozen members of the national assembly have switched sides from the APC mainly to the opposition PDP.The governor of the north-central state of Benue has also defected and at least two other governors may follow. Interestingly, the leaders of both the lower and upper houses of the national assembly, Yakubu Dogara and Bukola Saraki respectively, have not announced their defection - despite the fact that they were seen as the instigators of the current crisis. But they are both now viewed with suspicion - and there are calls for them to be expelled from the party so that their positions could be taken by core APC loyalists.\"Mr Buhari has been unable to put a lid on the competing ambitions within the party - as some governors and their political backers try to gain the upper hand with an eye to the presidency in 2023\"It is no secret that Mr Saraki does not see eye-to-eye with the president. He has just been cleared by the Supreme Court of corruption following an investigation initiated by Mr Buhari. Their tense relationship has meant that many important laws and appointments are being held up by parliament.Such delays are only going to worsen as both houses of parliament went into an abrupt eight-week recess immediately after the defections.Among the business now in limbo is one for the approval of money for the electoral commission to conduct the February 2019 election. And with party primaries due in the next few weeks, more turbulence is expected.The defectors have one thing on their minds - they want to secure their own political futures.They had figured out they were unlikely to secure nomination for the posts they were gunning for. Their key demand was an automatic ticket to run in the next election, but the APC refused.Many of them had joined the APC from the PDP, and feel their loyalty has not been rewarded.But Mr Buhari has been unable to put a lid on the competing ambitions within the party - as some governors and their political backers try to gain the upper hand with an eye to the presidency in 2023.Since the return to civilian rule in 1999, it is the powerful state governors who tend to have the most influence in their parties.Members of parliament just do not carry as much weight - and as consequence suffer from a high attrition rate, with only between 20 and 30% of them securing  a second term.  Despite these defections, the ruling party has said it is not worried as it still has a majority in both houses.This was exactly the position taken by the PDP before it went on to stare defeat in the face in 2015.For President Buhari and the APC to avoid a similar fate, they will need to do more to reassure their members and other Nigerians that they can be trusted with power beyond 2019. The president's patchy performance has meant that many Nigerians are not as enthused about the coming election as they were in 2015. Then they were full of hope. A Buhari presidency promised a tough stance on corruption, insecurity and to revitalise the economy.President Buhari has had limited success in the first two and the economy has worsened with unemployment at an all-time high.The only reason the president and his party may just win next February is that the opposition has yet to put up a credible alternative.There are also Nigerians who are unlikely to be able to bring themselves to vote for the PDP, blamed for creating a lot of the mess during its 16 years in power.With party primaries scheduled to take place between August and October, it is getting very late in the day for the opposition to find someone with the credibility and national name recognition to appeal to most Nigerians and the big power brokers who are a big factor in the elections.More from Mannir Dan Ali:Follow us on Twitter @BBCAfrica, on Facebook at BBC Africa or on Instagram at bbcafrica",

            "title": "Myanmar Rohingya: What will happen next after damning UN report?",
            "content": "After the United Nations released a damning report into the violence against Rohingya Muslims in Myanmar, we asked BBC South East Asia correspondent Jonathan Head and Geneva correspondent Imogen Foulkes what could happen next. Jonathan Head: The report is unusually strong; the authors do not mince their words, describing the Myanmar military in the most damning terms. They say there is a strong case for a genocide prosecution, and emphasise that accountability for the military inside Myanmar is impossible, and must therefore be pursued by the international community.Expect more energetic diplomacy at the UN, both in the Security Council and the General Assembly, to find a way to do this. The Myanmar government has rejected previous international reports documenting abuses against the Rohingya, but this one, compiled over more than a year, headed by three respected international legal experts, and likely to get public support at the UN, will be harder to dismiss.The report also condemns all of Myanmar's own inquiries into the abuses as worthless, making it harder for the government to take refuge behind them. The report compounds Myanmar's international isolation and puts its military leaders in the very worst category of human rights abusers, but will not significantly change the dynamics inside the country.Imogen Foulkes: The UN investigators say the situation in Myanmar should be referred to the International Criminal Court, a move which would have to be approved by the UN Security Council. It is more than likely that one of the five permanent council members, China, would veto such a move. Failing a referral to the ICC, the investigators suggest an independent criminal tribunal should be set up, as with Rwanda or former Yugoslavia.Such a tribunal could in theory be created by the UN General Assembly, avoiding a Security Council veto. For a tribunal to really function, however, Myanmar would have to co-operate, by ensuring that those indicted did turn up for trial. It took many years, and promises of a closer relationship with the EU, before Serbia and Croatia handed over their suspected war criminals to the Hague's tribunal.Imogen Foulkes: By naming six senior military figures, including the commander in chief of Myanmar's armed forces and his deputy, this UN team has gone further than any other. There have been many investigations into war crimes in Syria, and we know there is a long list of suspects, including, it is thought, very senior figures in the Syrian military and the government. But their names have never been made public. The Myanmar investigators must believe they can achieve something by naming names. Within hours of the report being published, there have already been consequences. The European Union is to hold a meeting this week, and will hear in person from the UN team. Facebook has removed accounts associated with Myanmar military leaders. A key concern in the UN report is the dissemination of misinformation designed to incite hate.Other possible actions could include sanctions, something the UN investigators also call for. The EU, or the UN Security Council, could impose travel bans on those named in the report, and could also freeze their financial assets. Imogen Foulkes: No-one can be convicted without the ICC or another form of tribunal. The UN team can investigate, but not prosecute. But the sheer weight of evidence gathered suggests there will have to be some form of prosecution, although it could be many years away.Jonathan Head: It's very unlikely Aung Sang Suu Kyi will face prosecution. The report acknowledges that the civilian government has no authority over the military in Myanmar, and that there is no evidence it knew of the military's plans to attack the Rohingya population. It does accuse her of failing to use her moral authority to curb the abuses, and says her government contributed to the crimes in Rakhine state by spreading false narratives, blocking independent investigations and denying the military's wrongdoing.The authors say their main focus for prosecutions must be on the military, which it finds primarily responsible. Perhaps the worst effect of this for Ms Suu Kyi is that she now finds herself in the same camp as men accused of the very worst human rights crimes, because she has insisted on backing the military's version of events in Rakhine. She could conceivably have supported the military's right to respond robustly to attacks by Rohingya militants last year while leaving the door open to credible investigations of human rights violations. She did not, and her international reputation has gone from being tarnished last year, to being shattered by this report.Imogen Foulkes: The UN may be hoping that this report helps Aung San Suu Kyi understand that if she wants to stay in power, or to exercise power more meaningfully than she has done so far, then she must support war crimes prosecutions. A first step could be for her to back the investigators' call for the resignation of Commander in Chief Min Aung Hlaing.Imogen Foulkes: Genocide is a very specific crime under international law. To show that genocide has occurred, intent to exterminate an entire group must be shown. Random violence, an army rampaging through a village, would not constitute genocide. But a co-ordinated campaign, with a clear line of command from senior generals to troops on the ground to persecute, kill, or deport a group (usually based on race, religion or ethnicity) would.In the case of Myanmar, the investigators said that factors \"pointing at such intent include the broader oppressive context and hate rhetoric; specific utterances of commanders and direct perpetrators; exclusionary policies, including to alter the demographic composition of Rakhine state; the level of organization indicating a plan for destruction; and the extreme scale and brutality of the violence\".Read more: Why the word 'genocide' is used so carefullyJonathan Head: The situation for Rohingya on both sides of the border with Bangladesh is dire. Inside Rakhine they live in fear, without legal status and subject to arbitrary restrictions on their movements and possibly worse. About 140,000 are confined to dismal camps, where they fled in the communal violence of 2012, whereas the much smaller number of Rakhine people displaced by the conflict have been re-housed or able to go back to their homes.In Bangladesh the population of refugees is many times too large for the area of land they occupy. They are sustained by a massive international aid effort, which at least offers food, shelter, education and medical treatment - the last two near-impossible to obtain when they lived in Myanmar. But they are constantly vulnerable to weather, environmental degradation, the abuses of organised gangs within the camps, and to the possibility that Bangladesh may one day make good its threat to move them all to a semi-submerged island which is even less suitable.The two countries have agreed to repatriate the refugees, but Myanmar is still tightly restricting access to Rakhine for most international agencies, and unwilling to address the terrible abuses that forced the Rohingya to flee. Buddhist resentment of the Rohingya in Rakhine has hardened and no effort is being made to persuade them to accept them back. In these conditions a return to Rakhine for the Rohingya is impossible to imagine, and they are stuck in limbo. A huge diaspora living in squalid camps can spell trouble in the long-term, as the fate of Palestinian refugees suggests.",

            "title": "China censorship after Xi Jinping presidency extension proposal",
            "content": "China's governing Communist Party has proposed removing a clause in the constitution which limits presidencies to two five-year terms - which means President Xi Jinping could remain as leader after the end of his second term in 2023. The controversial move has ignited discussion on Chinese social media and pushed online government censors into overdrive. Several key terms have suddenly been subjected to heavy censorship on Sina Weibo, China's Twitter-like microblog since Sunday. According to censorship-monitoring websites China Digital Times and Free Weibo, censored phrases include:So what's going on?The tradition of limiting China's presidencies to 10 years emerged in the 1990s, when veteran leader Deng Xiaoping sought to avoid a repeat of the chaos that had marked the Mao era and its immediate aftermath.Since Xi Jinping came to power in 2012 he has shown a readiness to write his own rules.But many observers have been alarmed at the prospect of Mr Xi becoming an \"emperor for life\", and critics have suggested this could set China's development back a century. China employs millions of people to monitor and censor internet activity. So it's not surprising that overtly critical posts, such as these two, were blocked:References to emperors, and 19th Century warlord Yuan Shikai, who notoriously tried to restore monarchy, are also being blocked, after censors clocked on that they were cryptic references to Xi Jinping, such as this one:Even posts using the phrase \"emigration\" have been censored - after several users alleged that there had been a spike in web users searching for \"emigration\" on search engine Baidu since the announcement was made. And what do censors have against Winnie the Pooh? Well, it's a nickname that social media users have coined for President Xi, which is often used derogatively. If you search for the phrase \"Winnie the Pooh\" on Sina Weibo, the site brings up a message saying: \"According to relevant laws, regulations and policies... search results are not displayed\".So what is allowed?The comments remaining on the popular Sina Weibo microblog are mostly monosyllabic statements from users simply say they \"like\" or \"approve\" the amendments. The snooker queen on top of the worldLift peeing video ignites fury in ChinaNZ reacts to 'creepy' PM Ardern interviewThey are likely to be from China's \"50 Cent Party\" - a nickname coined for internet commentators who are paid small amounts to post messages supporting the government's position. Some posts have attracted thousands of comments - but only a few are available to view. This is traditionally indicative of online censorship by government administrators. The way the proposed changes were announced on Sunday also appeared to be carefully planned.Whereas English-language media such as broadcaster CGTN prominently reported the removal of the requirement that presidents and vice presidents \"shall serve no more than two consecutive terms\", its Chinese-language equivalent did not highlight it. Instead, broadcaster CCTV instead issued the full list of amendments that were being made to the constitution, with the abolition of presidential terms listed 14th in 21 total proposed amendments. China's state-run Global Times has argued that the change does not mean \"that the Chinese president will have a lifelong tenure\". The paper quoted Su Wei, a Communist Party academic and party member, as saying it was a significant decision as China needed a \"stable, strong and consistent leadership\" from 2020-2035.BBC Monitoring reports and analyses news from TV, radio, web and print media around the world.

            "title": "'We are real': Saudi feminists launch online radio",
            "content": "Operating out of a small room in an unknown country, a new internet radio station broadcasts a programme aimed at campaigning for greater women's rights in Saudi Arabia.With melancholy music playing in the background, the presenter of Nsawya FM (Feminism FM) addresses the issue of domestic violence in the Gulf kingdom.The presenter's voice shakes with emotion as she discusses the fate of Sara, a woman she says was killed by a male relative.She was a 33-year-old university graduate with a job who lived with her parents - and who wanted to marry a man with a different nationality, that of Yemen.\"Sara's dream was ended with five bullets shot by her 22-year-old brother, even though she had been officially engaged with the consent of her parents,\" Ashtar, a 27 year old who uses a pseudonym inspired by the Mesopotamian goddess of love and war, later told BBC Arabic by phone.The case was reported by the media and discussed by people who knew her, Ashtar said.The presenter also told the story of Hanan Shahri, who is reported to have killed herself in 2013 after her brother and uncle allegedly beat her and refused to allow her to marry her fiancé.Such cases, Ashtar said, were \"only the tip of the iceberg\".Three weeks ago, Nsawya FM set up a Twitter account and announced it would broadcast a weekly programme that would be the \"voice of the silent majority\". It also called for volunteers who wanted to get involved in production or contribute material.In the past two weeks, the station has broadcast two one-hour programmes using only a microphone, a laptop with editing software and the live audio streaming website Mixlr. The poor quality of the sound and the whole production, in general, reflects the non-professional nature of this project.Ashtar said they did not expect a massive audience initially, and were instead aiming for \"gradual growth\" as the programme spread awareness on women's rights.\"We started this project to archive this phase for history, so that people would know we were real, we did exist,\" explained Ashtar, who did not want so share any details about her own identity despite living outside the kingdom because she feared reprisals.\"The Saudi authorities could ban Twitter at any moment and we would lose the archive of our thoughts. Whereas the radio gives us the opportunity to record programmes and broadcast them on other platforms,\" she added.At least 17 human rights defenders and women's rights activists critical of the Saudi government have been arrested or detained since mid-May, according to the UN. Several of them have been accused of serious crimes, including \"suspicious contact with foreign parties\", and could face up to 20 years in prison if convicted.  Nsawya FM has two presenters and nine women producing content. All but two of the women are Saudi nationals, and some of the women live in Saudi Arabia.The women say communication between them is difficult because they live in different time zones and some have other demands on their time, including studies or work.Ashtar described herself as \"an activist who uses the media to express her ideas\".She said she had sent articles to a number of leading Lebanese publications in recent years but that none of them had ended up being used. She believed that the rejections were the result of her \"confrontational\" ideas about society, religion and politics.Ashtar expressed admiration for the \"the Matriarchal era\" - an apparent reference to a period in pre-Islamic Arabia when women were the leaders of their tribes.\"I believe that women are better than men. If women were to hold power again, especially in certain sectors like the judiciary, this world would be a better place,\" she explained.Ashtar said she did not hide her beliefs from her family and took the opportunity to debate them with relatives at gatherings for Eid al-Fitr and other festivals.But her family rejected them. \"The West has brainwashed you,\" they used to tell her.Now that the ban on women driving has been lifted by King Salman, activists like Ashtar are campaigning to for an end to the male guardianship system, which they say is discriminatory. Under the system, men are given the authority to make a range of critical decisions on behalf of their female relatives.The activists have taken their campaign to Twitter, the most popular social media platform in Saudi Arabia. Saudi women are very active there.However, many people in the kingdom frown on women using the site to push for reforms. Some have denounced the activists as \"spies\" and \"not Saudis\", or described them as \"electronic flies\" in an attempt to play down their significance.Others have urged them to wait and give the king a chance to enact further reforms.\"This is a mere propaganda. We are Saudis and we know it,\" Ashtar said.\"Had he wanted to, the king could have abolished the guardianship system. This does not need decades of discussions and consultations. All it takes is one signature.\"",

            "content": "Senator John McCain has been buried at the US Naval Academy in Annapolis, Maryland, after a small private ceremony.A military flypast was performed with the squadron one plane short, to symbolise the dead senator.Mr McCain graduated from the elite Naval Academy in 1958, later serving in Vietnam as a fighter jet pilot.Family and friends were joined by his classmates and the current midshipmen for a service at the school's chapel.It caps a week of memorials for Mr McCain, who died on 25 August, aged 81, from the effects of brain cancer.On Saturday, heavyweights from across the political spectrum gathered at the Washington National Cathedral to remember the Arizona senator, who became one of America's most high-profile politicians. Two former presidents - George W Bush and Barack Obama - paid tribute to Mr McCain's courage and sense of honour. A eulogy by the statesman's daughter Meghan, one of his seven children, included a thinly veiled swipe at President Donald Trump.\"The America of John McCain has no need to be made great again, because America was always great,\" she said.Crowds lined the route as the senator's final motorcade travelled to the academy in Annapolis.  Mr McCain was buried next to his classmate and friend, Admiral Chuck Larson, who reserved four plots in the idyllic cemetery for the pair and their wives before his death in 2014.\"Chuck has his wingman back now,\" the late admiral's widow, Sarah Larson, told CNN.Mr McCain's sons Jack and Don were scheduled to pay tribute to him at the Sunday ceremony, alongside retired Army General David Petraeus and Senator Lindsey Graham, a long-time friend.President Trump - who had major personal and political differences with Mr McCain - has spent the weekend at his private golf course in Virginia, and did not attend.Former US Senator Joseph Lieberman, a friend and colleague of Mr McCain who also gave a eulogy at Saturday's service, told CNN on Sunday: \"I say goodbye and my heart will be heavy. I'll shed a tear and yet I'll thank God that I knew a man like John McCain so well.\"",

            "title": "How will the US move to cut aid affect Pakistan?",
            "content": "The Trump administration says it is cutting almost all security aid to Pakistan until it deals with terrorist networks operating on its soil. But will the cuts have any impact, asks the BBC's M Ilyas Khan.The US has yet to announce exactly how much aid will be cut - but defence experts believe the total impact of the visible aid suspension may fall in the range of more than $900m (£660m).This includes the suspension of $255m due to Pakistan for military equipment and training under the Foreign Military Financing (FMF) fund, and $700m under the Coalition Support Fund (CSF) - paid to Pakistan for conducting operations against militant groups.Experts believe the total financial impact of an adverse US policy on Pakistan could be much higher than this though, especially as the US state department has said an unspecified amount of other security assistance managed by the department of defence could be cut.Security experts believe the cuts are likely to put a squeeze on the Pakistani military, at least in the short run.\"If the US pipeline dries up, the military's immediate plans for upgrading of materiel and manpower resources will be stalled,\" says Prof Hasan Askari Rizvi, a defence analyst and author of the book, Military, State and Society in Pakistan.\"It will also be a setback in the long term as China or any other friendly country cannot totally replace the resources that Pakistan needs to keep its military machine well oiled,\" he says.This could explain the government's response to the cuts. While Pakistani politicians have been quick to condemn the US in the media, with Foreign Minister Khwaja Asif calling the US a \"friend-killer\" whose attitude \"matches neither that of a friend nor an ally\" and Defence Minister Khurram Dastgir warning against \"American mischief\", other government reaction has been more cautious.The foreign office talked of Pakistan's efforts to bring peace to the region, which it said was done mostly at its own cost - $120bn over 15 years - and argued that \"arbitrary deadlines, unilateral pronouncements and shifting goalposts are counterproductive in addressing common threats\".Meanwhile, in a written reply to the BBC an army spokesman said Pakistan had \"never fought for money but for peace\".Experts believe that, despite the verbal sparring on TV, the military will actually be tempted to put a squeeze on militant groups that are believed to have sanctuaries, recruitment and training facilities on Pakistani soil - just as the US has demanded.\"Though it may not be visible, there certainly will be some changes in Pakistan's approach to militants,\" says Prof Askari.\"At the very least, they may ask groups like the Haqqani network to go low-key for a while.\" Pakistan's main leverage with the US lies in its geographical location and its role in Afghanistan - the fact that it controls the only supply line into the landlocked country for international troops, and has influence over the militant groups that are fighting there.The question is, will Pakistan try to press its advantage by shutting overland access of US supplies to Kabul?It's happened before. Pakistan blocked this route for several months in 2011 and 2012 after a series of embarrassing events, including the killing of Osama Bin Laden in a secret operation by US Navy Seals, and the bombing of a Pakistani post by American jets that killed more than 20 soldiers.But Prof Askari believes Pakistan may not take that route this time. In 2011, the US appeared more accommodating, following Pakistani anger at the US operation and the bombing of the post.But this time, the anger is coming from the US side - and too drastic a move from Pakistan could aggravate the situation.\"Pakistanis may create hurdles or cause delays in the transit of such supplies, but they are unlikely to block it completely, because that could lead to suspension of all ties,\" Prof Askari says.At the moment, the US is still providing Pakistan with non-military aid. And even in the case of military assistance, it is believed the US may follow a \"condition and issue-based approach\" where funds would be released for identified and measurable actions.By contrast, a total cut-off of relations would mean that the US could remove Pakistan from its list of major non-Nato allies, designate it as a state sponsor of terrorism, or work with India and Afghanistan to more aggressively counter its interests in the region.Neither side is likely to want such a drastic move.Analysts have pointed out that the US does not want instability in Pakistan. Pakistan has one of the world's fastest-growing nuclear programmes, as well as several Islamist terrorist organisations on its soil, so \"America and its allies are rightly concerned that any instability in Pakistan may result in terrorists getting their hands on Pakistan's nuclear technology\", Christine Fair, a US-based South Asia expert, says.",

            "content": "Talks between the US and Canada about amending the North American Free Trade Agreement (Nafta) have ended for the week without reaching a deal.US officials said they would meet their Canadian counterparts again next week in an effort to reach agreement. For now, the US plans to move forward with a deal with Mexico on terms reached earlier in the week.It's not clear what this means for the trilateral agreement, which governs more than $1tr (£770bn) in trade.The White House had faced a Friday deadline to provide Congress with the necessary 90 days' notice that it intended to enter into a new trade agreement and still have the new Nafta deal signed by 1 December, the day Mexico's new left-wing President Andres Manuel Lopez Obrador takes office.The US wants Canada to open up access to US dairy products, extend patent protections for medicines and agree to eliminate international panels to resolve most disputes between investors and governments.Dairy in particular appeared to be an issue on Friday, with US officials saying Canada had made no concessions on agriculture and Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau saying he was standing firm on the issue. Canadian Foreign Affairs Minister Chrystia Freeland said on Friday afternoon that the two countries are making progress and that an agreement is \"within reach\". \"With goodwill and flexibility on all sides we can get there,\" she said. She also said Canada does not feel the same deadline pressure as the US.\"For Canada, the focus is on getting a good deal and once we have a good deal for Canada, we'll be done,\" she said.President Donald Trump notified Congress on Friday that he intended to sign a new trade agreement with Mexico in 90 days, and Canada \"if it is willing\", US Trade Representative Robert Lighthizer said.He said talks with Canada this week had been \"constructive\". Officials said the US is on track to present text of the agreement in 30 days.\"Our officials are continuing to work toward agreement.  The USTR team will meet with Minister Freeland and her colleagues Wednesday of next week,\" Mr Lighthizer said.Mr Trump said earlier this week he was willing to cut Canada out of the pact. But it is not clear whether Congress, which has final say over trade agreements, will accept a deal if Canada is not part of it. Several senators have questioned whether the White House has the authority to negotiate a deal without Canada.Business groups have also said it is critical that Canada be part of any agreement.\"Anything other than a trilateral agreement won't win Congressional approval and would lose business support,\" said Thomas Donahue, president of the US Chamber of Commerce.The preliminary agreement announced by the US and Mexico earlier this week included provisions aimed at boosting vehicle production in North America and easing online commerce, among other matters.On Friday, Mexico's Economy Minister Ildefonso Guajardo hailed the US decision to notify Congress as a sign of progress. Mexico will continue to press for Canada to remain in the updated accord, he added.Mr Trump has taken a tough-talking approach to Canada and threatened to levy tariffs on car parts exported from Canada to the US if a deal is not reached.In off-the-record comments made to Bloomberg on Thursday and leaked to the Toronto Star, he boasted that any deal with Canada would be \"totally on our terms\". \"Here's the problem. If I say no - the answer's no,\" he said according to the report. The president later acknowledged the remarks in a tweet, saying: \"At least Canada knows where I stand!\"Wow, I made OFF THE RECORD COMMENTS to Bloomberg concerning Canada, and this powerful understanding was BLATANTLY VIOLATED. Oh well, just more dishonest reporting. I am used to it. At least Canada knows where I stand!End of Twitter post  by @realDonaldTrumpMr Trump has also frequently expressed his distaste for multilateral trade agreements, especially Nafta.In a 2016 presidential debate with Democratic rival Hillary Clinton, he described Nafta as \"the worst trade deal maybe ever signed anywhere\" and a \"killer\" of US jobs.Once in office he said he wanted to renegotiate - not scrap - the accord, triggering the last year of talks.The US has been embroiled in a tit-for-tat trade battle on several fronts in recent months.It has imposed tariffs on steel and aluminium, including from Mexico, Canada and the European Union.It is also engaged in a tit-for-tat trade war with China, as the world's two largest economies wrangle for global influence and place tariffs on each others' goods.A third round of US tariffs on $200bn (£154bn) of Chinese goods could come as soon as next week, according to a Bloomberg report. Asked to confirm this during the Bloomberg interview, President Trump said that it was \"not totally wrong\".Mr Trump has also threatened to place tariffs on imports of cars and vehicle parts, prompting a stand-off with the European Union.",

            "title": "New Mexico compound gang arrested by FBI",
            "content": "Five adults at a desert compound in New Mexico have been arrested by the FBI weeks after a judge received death threats for granting them bail. The two men and three women, residents at a site where 11 starving children and the buried remains of a toddler were found, face conspiracy charges.Child abuse charges against the five were dismissed after a 10-day limit for a hearing was missed by prosecutors.They will now remain in custody pending a hearing in federal court on Tuesday.The charges include unlawful possession of firearms by an illegal immigrant, which carries a maximum sentence of 10 years in prison, and aiding and abetting in the committing of an offence, the FBI said in a statement on Friday. The accused had been under FBI drone surveillance at their remote compound north of Taos since May, according to Taos County Sheriff Jerry Hogrefe.Police raided the compound near Amalia in early August in the search for a missing three-year-old boy, Abdul-Ghani Wahhaj.It was then that they discovered the remains of a young boy along with 11 malnourished children, who were reportedly being held at the site. Police also seized \"at least 11 firearms and a large quantity of ammunition\".The boy's father, Siraj Wahhaj, is suspected of abducting him from his Georgia home in December and was one of the five arrested. He was detained at the site, along with Lucas Morten, Jany Leveille, Hujhrah Wahhaj and Subhannah Wahhaj.On 13 August, Judge Sarah Backus granted bail to the five defendants after she said the prosecution had failed to convince her that they were a threat to the community.The prosecution argued that all five adults were dangerous and claimed they had trained the children to use weapons and prepare to carry out school shootings.\"The state alleges that there was a big plan afoot, but the state hasn't shown to my satisfaction, in clear and convincing evidence, what that plan was,\" Judge Backus said. She ordered that all five must wear ankle monitors and have weekly contact with their lawyers.But her decision was met with protests including an email in which she was called an \"Islamic terror sympathiser\".The Taos County court building was evacuated briefly on Tuesday after the threats.Prosecutors also said that the remains found at the site were those of Abdul-Ghani and that the other children said the boy had died during a \"religious ritual... intended to cast out demonic spirits\", during which Siraj Wahhaj had put his hand to his son's forehead, and recited verses from the Koran. Abdul-Ghani suffered from seizures, but Mr Wahhaj believed the boy was possessed by the devil and needed to be exorcised, court papers said.However defence lawyers accused the prosecution of treating the five suspects unfairly because they are Muslim - something the prosecutors deny.Defence lawyer Thomas Clark said after the hearing that if the accused were Christian and white then \"nobody would bat an eye over the idea of faith healing\". \"But when black Muslims do it, there seems to be something nefarious, something evil,\" he said.

            "title": "Why confidence in Argentina's economy is dwindling",
            "content": "When a business-friendly conservative was elected president of Argentina in October 2015, hopes were high he would put the South American country's economy on a stable path. Mauricio Macri promised to revive Argentina's economy and achieve \"zero poverty\".  But less than three years later, he has unexpectedly asked for the early release of a loan from the International Monetary Fund (IMF). What has gone wrong?The Argentine peso has lost more than 40% of its value against the US dollar this year and inflation is rampant. Everyday life is getting more expensive for Argentines, as the prices of many goods and services still bear a close relation to the US dollar.The government of President Macri has not been able to lower inflation, which is the highest amongst G20 nations. It is failing to enact the economic reforms it promised the IMF, most of them aimed at curbing public spending and borrowing.And the combination of spiralling inflation and public spending cuts means wages are not keeping pace with prices, making most people poorer.Argentina has been plagued by economic problems for years but the commodities boom of the past decades helped the country repay the money it owed the IMF. It cleared its entire debt to the multilateral organisation in 2007.Argentina's economy began to stabilise under President Néstor Kirchner, who governed from 2003 to 2007, but became more shaky again under his wife and successor in office, Cristina Fernández de Kirchner.Her government, which was in power from 2007 until 2015, raised public spending, nationalised companies and heavily subsidised many items of daily life ranging from utilities to football transmissions on television.Most importantly it controlled the exchange rate, which created all sorts of practical problems, such as giving rise to a black market for dollars and heavily distorting prices.Mr Macri was elected on a promise of ending all distortions and returning Argentina to a market-oriented economy where supply and demand, not the state, would define prices.In his first hours in office he put an end to capital controls and began a global campaign to repair Argentina's reputation with foreign investors. He also promised to bring down inflation, which was hovering around 40% per year, by curbing public spending.Argentina's government insists its problem lies with liquidity (a lack of cash) and not with solvency (its ability to meet its financial obligations). In May, it turned to the IMF for help, arguing that the Washington-based fund was the cheapest source of financing available. The argument went that with a loan from the IMF, Argentina would be able to intervene in currency markets for longer and also pay off bonds coming up for payment.At the time, President Macri said he did not plan to use the $50bn (£37.2bn) loan from the IMF except to boost the country's reserves. But with the peso sliding further and hit by a poor soybean and maize harvest, the economy continued to deteriorate. In June, the economy fell by 6.7%, its worst downturn since 2009.With confidence in Argentina's recovery eroded, President Macri on 29 August unexpectedly asked for the early release of the IMF loan.IMF chief Christine Lagarde said the fund was ready to help Argentina but news of the request for early assistance caused the peso to drop more than 7%, its biggest one-day decline since the currency was floated.Going to the IMF is the most unpopular move a president could make in Argentina, where the organisation is widely loathed and blamed for the 2001 economic collapse.In general, Argentines are not quick to panic, having been through so much economic turmoil in the past. But there are people expressing serious concern, especially those from the older generation which lived through Argentina's 2001 economic crisis when the government defaulted on its debt and the banking system was largely paralysed.The effect on Argentines was devastating with many seeing their hard-won prosperity quickly disappearing.Those who experienced it fear a return of the corralito (ring fence), the Spanish name given to government restrictions imposed in 2001 to prevent a bank run.  Under the corralito's constraints, which lasted for a year, people could not freely withdraw money from their accounts, making life very difficult for ordinary Argentines. ",

            "title": "Letter from Africa: The Ghana quiz show bigger than the World Cup",
            "content": "In our series of letters from African journalists, Ghanaian writer Elizabeth Ohene gets quizzical.We have just had the climax of one of the most exciting competitions. No, it was not the Fifa World Cup, which we have been watching without much passion since our cousins the Nigerians failed to make it out of the group stages. The competition that has gripped the country for weeks was the finals of the National Science and Maths Quiz and the grand finale took place earlier this month.The quiz is open to senior high schools and has been running on national television since 1994. It has a cult following among students, parents and especially old students of the schools who appear to be even more passionate than the current ones. This is an enterprise that was started with the stated aim of promoting science and mathematics in our society and if one were to judge simply from the popularity of the programme, you would be tempted to say that the mission of the originators has been accomplished. But I am beginning to think that it is not the content of the competition that is the source of its popularity but the competition for competition sake. In other words, who won and who lost is more important than what the viewers and listeners might have learnt from the questions. The legend says that the programme was born when someone asked his friends why birds could stand on a live electric wire without getting electrocuted, but human beings could not do so. Luckily for him his friends were scientists and professors and they offered him an explanation. One thing led to another and they decided that it would be a good idea to have a quiz programme on national television to promote science and mathematics. One of them was a professor of biochemistry and she became the quiz mistress. She said she agreed to be quiz mistress to encourage females and young ones to become scientists. Elizabeth Ohene:I must confess I am not sure I know the answer to why birds don't get electrocutedThere have since been only female quiz mistresses and the current one is the third in the series, Quiz Mistress Dr Elsie Kaufmann, head of the biomedical engineering department at the University of Ghana, Legon.So, has the success of the programme led to science and mathematics becoming more popular in our country? And what about the idea of using the programme to entice more young people to become scientists and serving as a role model for female scientists? I have tried my own very unscientific survey on some young people. Almost all of them could tell me which schools had been doing well in the competition, but not one person could remember the questions that had been asked. Since the competition started, more than 450 schools have participated but only 11 schools have won the first prize. Only once has a mixed school come on top and all the other times, the boys schools have been the winners.  The girls schools I notice, make it to the quarters and a few times to the semi-finals but not once has a girls school made it into the finals. And yet the girls schools do very well in the West African School Certificate Exams and feature prominently in the admissions into the medical schools, which would provide proof that they do well in science and mathematics.But it looks like the country as a whole has some serious thinking to do about the state of science and mathematics in our schools and in our society as a whole. The West African Examination Council has just announced the results of this year's West African School Certificate Exam results and they make sad reading. We did not do well in mathematics and science and they are core subjects that the young people are required to get credits in to be able to get any further education.  Then there was the news item that shook the country back in 2015. The story said that Ghana had been ranked last among 76 countries across the world in the biggest ever global school rankings in mathematics and science.This was a ranking said to have been done by the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD). Nobody here took any comfort in the fact that other countries in the lowest ranks were Oman, Morocco, Honduras, South Africa which were ranked 72, 73, 74 and 75 respectively.What should we make of our keenly contested National Science and Mathematics Quiz?  And I must confess I am not sure I know the answer to why birds don't get electrocuted when they stand on live electric wires. And it was this question that gave birth to the quiz in the first place.

            "title": "Nauru refugees: The island where children have given up on life",
            "content": "Suicide attempts and horrifying acts of self-harm are drawing fresh attention to the suffering of refugee children on Nauru, in what is being described as a \"mental health crisis\". The tiny island nation, site of Australia's controversial offshore processing centre, has long been plagued with allegations of human rights abuses. But a series of damning media reports recently has also highlighted a rapidly deteriorating situation for young people.\"We are starting to see suicidal behaviour in children as young as eight and 10 years old,\" says Louise Newman, professor of psychiatry at the University of Melbourne who works with families and children on the island.\"It's absolutely a crisis.\" Australia intercepts all asylum seekers and refugees who try to reach its shores by boat. It insists they will never be able to resettle in Australia, so over the years has sent many to privately run \"processing centres\" it funds on Nauru and in Papua New Guinea. Groups working with families on Nauru paint a brutal picture of life for children on the island. Many have lived most of their life in detention, with no idea of what their future will be. The trauma they have endured, coupled with poor - and often dangerous conditions - contribute to a sense of hopelessness.  Natasha Blucher, detention advocacy manager at the Asylum Seeker Resource Centre (ASRC), was unable to share details of specific cases with the BBC due to privacy and safety concerns. But she said ASRC works with about 15 children who have either made repeated suicide attempts or are regularly self-harming. She also believes the problem has reached crisis point. ASRC, like most advocates and medical professionals, assist families on Nauru remotely as access to the island is heavily restricted. It estimates at least 30 children are suffering from traumatic withdrawal syndrome - also known as resignation syndrome. It's a rare psychiatric condition where sufferers, as a response to severe trauma, effectively withdraw from life. The condition can be life-threatening as victims become unable to eat and drink. \"Around three months ago we were seeing a smattering of this... then over that period it seems to have proliferated,\" Ms Blucher told the BBC. Children ‘attempting suicide’ at Greek refugee campProf Newman, a former advisor to the Australian government on the mental health of asylum seekers, says the outbreak of this very serious condition is particularly concerning. \"In many ways it's not surprising… they are exposed to a lot of trauma there [and] a sense of hopelessness and abandonment. They feel very unsafe\". Another physician assisting with children's cases is GP Barri Phatarfod. Her organisation Doctors 4 Refugees has not been allowed to visit Nauru but receives referrals from advocates for assessment and advice. She says of the 60 cases referred to her organisation, every child has some mental health impairment. \"It's impossible not to,\" she says. \"They witness suicide attempts almost daily as well as sexual harassment and physical and sexual abuse and there is no prospect of release.\" At present most cases involve children from Iran, as well as kids from Iraq, Lebanon and Rohinyga. Dr Phatarfod adds that children as young as three are \"displaying inappropriately sexualised behaviour - behaviour that typically only comes from having this acted upon themselves\". One key proponent of the policy was the country's new prime minister, Scott Morrison, who rose to national prominence as a hardline immigration minister. Mr Morrison was one of the toughest enforcers of the divisive \"Stop the Boats\" policy and years later, becomes leader as unease over the treatment of asylum seekers hasn't abated.  Supporters argue the policy has been highly effective, resulting in a dramatic drop in illegal boat arrivals. The government said a vessel that made land this week was the first boat carrying illegal asylum seekers to reach Australia since 2014. But critics point to the huge physical and mental toll exacted on the people placed in offshore detention facilities. In 2015, the site on Nauru became an \"open centre,\" meaning residents can come and go as they please. But this has done little to improve life for children on the island. The tiny Pacific island is just 21 sq km (8 sq miles) and covered with phosphate rocks. It was mined heavily and has few trees or animals. Advocates say even though the camp is technically open, there are few places for people to go. As the children's health crisis worsens, a coalition of human rights groups has demanded the Australian government remove the 119 asylum seeker children off Nauru and resettled them elsewhere. In a statement, the Australian government said it \"takes seriously its role in supporting the Government of Nauru to ensure that children are protected from abuse, neglect or exploitation\". \"A range of care, welfare and support arrangements are in place to provide for the needs of children and young people,\" it said. Medical services including a hospital are available on Nauru but experts say they are inadequate. If a person needs more complex treatment, a referral must be made to the Nauruan government to have them transferred overseas for care. \"When a person cannot receive appropriate treatment for a significant health condition in Nauru, the person is offered treatment in Taiwan, Papua New Guinea or Australia. Those cases are referred to the Department by the person's treating clinician,\" the Australian government said. Still, many argue the system of referrals is failing children on Nauru. Advocates say the process is too slow, and they are overwhelmed by the volume of children experiencing mental health problems. Jennifer Kanis, head of the social justice practice at law firm Maurice Blackburn, is leading several cases to bring urgent medical care to young people on the island. She believes that even though these children have never entered Australian territory, the Australian government has a duty of care. \"It devastating… that we have to take legal action to get proper medical care for these kids,\" Ms Kanis says.   \"The government is more concerned with their policy of keeping this cohort of people seeking asylum off Australia than they are with their health.\" ",

            "title": "Cambodia jails Australian filmmaker found guilty of espionage",
            "content": "An Australian filmmaker has been sentenced by a Cambodian court to six years in prison on charges of spying for an unnamed country.  James Ricketson, 69, was arrested in June 2017 while flying a camera drone over an opposition rally. Ricketson denies the charges and his lawyer said he would appeal against the verdict.His arrest comes amid a wider crackdown on dissent by the increasingly authoritarian government in Phnom Penh.Ricketson has visited Cambodia frequently over the last 20 years and been a firm critic of long-term Prime Minister Hun Sen.Local pro-government media had labelled the filmmaker as a spy acting to promote revolution, but Ricketson expressed only disbelief at the charge.\"Which country was I conducting espionage for?\" he said in court after the verdict was announced, Reuters news agency reports. \"The Phnom Penh Municipal Court has decided to convict James Ricketson and sentences him to six years in prison for espionage and collecting information that is harmful to the nation between December 2010 and June 2017,\" Judge Seng Leang said.During trial, the prosecution argued that Ricketson's work had damaged Cambodia's reputation on the world stage. The prosecution's main argument relied on several emails in which he expressed sympathy for opposition groups. In one email, he urged Australia's government to withdraw an invitation for Hun Sen in 2016. Jonathan Head, BBC South East Asia correspondentThe Cambodian courts make little pretence at being independent from political interference, and many will see this verdict in that light. James Ricketson has been an outspoken critic of the government of Hun Sen. In the past that was not a problem, when Cambodia enjoyed one of the freest media environments in South East Asia  following the UN-supervised peace agreement of the early 1990s. But in recent years Hun Sen has become intolerant of criticism, accused of using the courts to lock up activists, and most recently, the main opposition leader Kem Sokha on a charge of colluding with the US to overthrow the government. Little evidence had been produced to back that charge, or the charge against Ricketson. But both men are still incarcerated, and are likely to remain in jail until they are no longer deemed a threat.  With the main opposition party banned, Hun Sen easily won the most recent general election in July. His increasingly authoritarian rule has been widely condemned by western governments, but Cambodia no longer needs their aid as its economy is dominated by China. The veteran Prime Minister has shown leniency after that election victory, releasing some of his critics. It is possible he will do the same for James Ricketson before the end of his six-year sentence.His family has expressed dismay over the verdict stating: \"James is not a spy. James loves Cambodia and the Cambodian people. He is a filmmaker and a humanitarian\".The filmmaker's lawyer told media that if the verdict is upheld, the Australian government should take diplomatic action. The ruling comes as observers increasingly accuse Cambodia's government of authoritarian rule to suppress dissent. The opposition Cambodia National Rescue Party (CNRP) behind the rally Mr Ricketson was filming has since been banned, leaving the government without any serious political opponent. In this year's general election, Hun Sen's ruling party claimed a landslide victory, but it was a poll that was widely criticised for its failure to allow serious opposition.Hun Sen, a former soldier in the Khmer Rouge who later opposed them, has presided over a sustained period of rapid economic growth.But he has long been accused of using the courts and security forces to crush dissent and intimidate critics.",

            "content": "A German court has sentenced an Afghan migrant to eight and a half years for killing his 15-year-old ex-girlfriend.Abdul D, as he is identified, admitted to stabbing Mia V to death in December in the south-western town of Kandel.Prosecutors believe he acted out of jealousy and revenge after Mia, a German citizen, broke up with him.The case sparked national outrage, and led to far-right groups holding xenophobic protests as part of their broad anti-migrant campaign. Demonstrations have also gripped the eastern city of Chemnitz, after a 35-year-old man was fatally stabbed and two men from Syria and Iraq were arrested.Mia and Abdul D met at school and dated for several months before she ended the relationship a few weeks before her death, prosecutors said. She was stabbed seven times with a kitchen knife by her ex-boyfriend, believed to be from Afghanistan, outside a shop on 27 December. She and her parents had previously gone to the police about Abdul's harassing and threatening behaviour.Abdul D's lawyer told reporters that he thought the Landau district court's decision was correct and that his client had \"accepted\" the sentence of eight years and six months.The murder trial was held behind closed doors in a juvenile court, where prosecutors sought a maximum term of 10 years.The Afghan said he was 15 at the time of the crime, but an expert medical assessment ordered by prosecutors said that he was more likely to be between 17 and 20 years old. He arrived in Germany in April 2016 as an unaccompanied minor and had his request for asylum rejected in February 2017. At the time of the crime, he was living in a supervised group in the town of Neustadt and attending school in Kandel.The case is among a number of high-profile crimes said to involve asylum seekers which have stoked anger against migrants and put pressure on Chancellor Angela Merkel over her liberal refugee policy.Regular demonstrations have been held in Kandel, home to 9,000 people, by the far-right Alternative for Germany (AfD) in an attempt to bolster its anti-migrant campaign.On the other side of the country - in Chemnitz - thousands of people have taken to the streets to protest, after a German-Cuban man was stabbed to death there on 26 August.",

            "title": "Letter from Africa: Did Mugabe's support backfire?",
            "content": "In our series of letters from Africa, journalist-turned-barrister Brian Hungwe looks at Zimbabwe's election fallout.The maxim that there are no permanent friends in politics has never been truer than in Zimbabwe, where historic elections took place last week.The polls were the first without Robert Mugabe - the man who has dominated politics since the country gained independence in 1980 and who at the age of 93 was unceremoniously ousted from power in November.His downfall was partly because of his attempt to foist his wife, Grace Mugabe, to higher office through Zanu-PF, which one faction of the ruling party - and some army generals - could not stomach. \"It was never imaginable, not for a single day, that I would live to see Mr Mugabe voting for the MDC\"His expulsion from power and party led Mr Mugabe to have an ideological change of heart.The day before last Monday's election, he urged people to abandon the \"undemocratic\" Zanu-PF, the party he helped set up 55 years ago, and to back the opposition Movement of Democratic Change (MDC) Alliance.It was never imaginable, not for a single day, that I would live to see Mr Mugabe voting for the MDC.In office, he consistently attacked the MDC as a puppet of the West, saying it was created to reverse the revolutionary gains of our independence and preserve the interests of white people on the commercial farms that he had grabbed in violent seizures.At many of his campaign rallies in the last decade and half, he branded whoever crossed the floor as a shameful sell-out.But what struck me most as Mr Mugabe slouched in his chair at his upmarket residence in the capital, Harare, addressing the world's media, was his use of the word \"undemocratic\".His regime's brutal crackdown on the opposition has been well documented - with photos to show how opponents were dealt with.One of those who suffered was current MDC Alliance leader Nelson Chamisa.He was on his way to a European Union meeting in Brussels in March 2007 when he was beaten up by state agents and left for dead at the airport.Eight days before this, then MDC leader, Morgan Tsvangirai, and 50 senior party leaders had been barred from attending a prayer rally. They too had been beaten, prompting the regional body, the Southern African Development Community (Sadc) to intervene.While lying helplessly on his hospital bed, Mr Chamisa said in an interview that he was paying the price for fighting for democracy.Now the very man who had wanted him dead gave him his vote in the just ended election.If Mr Mugabe had had his way, he would have stood against the 40-year-old Mr Chamisa as, until the military intervention which led to the nonagenarian's removal from power, Zanu-PF had declared him their candidate for the 2018 election.And while Mr Mugabe was endorsing his former enemy, the same white farmers that he reviled were in their hundreds at Borrowdale Race Course in Harare embracing his successor Emmerson Mnangagwa, a Zanu-PF stalwart who was once Mr Mugabe's right-hand man.It was another illustration of how dramatically the political landscape has changed.It would have been understandable for those former white farmers to stick with the MDC. But they now see their political interests safer with Mr Mnangagwa, who has promised 99-year leases to those who want to return to farming.As the election dust settles - with the victory of Mr Mnangagwa being challenged by the MDC Alliance - Mr Mugabe's decision to give his vote to Mr Chamisa is now a source of debate.Did it add or subtract to Mr Chamisa's political fortunes?There has even been speculation that Mr Mugabe funded the opposition - something that has led to divisions within the MDC Alliance.Mr Chamisa has shrugged off such criticism, saying after the election that one vote did not make Mr Mugabe an ally.\"Don't victimise Mr Mugabe for voting for a candidate of his choice, it is his right as a citizen. I thank him if he voted for me,\" he added.The MDC Alliance leader alleges that Zanu-PF rigging lost him the presidential election - by inflating numbers in some areas, something the ruling party denies.However, top MDC official Douglas Mwonzora believes it was Mr Mugabe who cost the party votes in an election some say was the most fair since 1980.\"My opposition to Mugabe is known in the party. I did not like Mugabe. I have opposed working with him. I think Mugabe is a kiss of death,\" he told the state-run Herald newspaper.Whatever Mr Mugabe's true relationship with the MDC Alliance is, electoral expert Tarisai Mutangi says his comments on the day before the polls, when campaigning was barred, cannot be ignored.\"He was a lonely significant voice of the day. It would certainly have had an impact on the election.\"Now Mr Mugabe may even be regretting his choice as he is still without friends in the corridors of powers.He revealed that he has yet to receive a pension worth $467,000 (£367,000) from the government and that his mansion in Borrowdale Brooke is leaking and needs renovations.As a voter I have learnt one thing from this election - never trust a politician. They have few, if any, principles.Follow us on Twitter @BBCAfrica, on Facebook at BBC Africa or on Instagram at bbcafrica",

            "title": "May in Africa: UK prime minister's mission to woo continent after Brexit",
            "content": "The UK's historical relationship with many African countries still counts for something, but, as Prime Minister Theresa May will find on her trip to the continent, the UK now vies for attention with larger economies offering greater riches.Mrs May is travelling to South Africa, Nigeria and Kenya this week on her first African visit as prime minister as she looks to boost Britain's post-Brexit trade.Britain's aim after leaving the European Union in March next year is to \"deepen and strengthen its global partnerships\", Mrs May said in a statement. \"This week I am looking forward to discussing how we can do that alongside Africa to help deliver important investment and jobs as well as continue to work together to maintain stability and security.\"But it might be a hard sell.The UK is introducing legislation that should mean that African businesses will access the UK market on the same terms as they do now.Nevertheless, African countries, many of them former British colonies, will need to redefine their relationship with Britain in the wake of Brexit. The continent's leaders need to decide who to prioritise: an ambitious but friendly China, the huge European Union bloc, the potential riches of the United States, or the historically-linked United Kingdom. In 2015, total trade (imports and exports combined) between Africa and the UK amounted to $36bn (£28bn), but that figure for the EU as a whole was $305bn. In the same year, trade between China and Africa totalled $188bn, and between the US and Africa is amounted to $53bn.To sweeten her offer, the prime minister is bringing along a delegation of 29 business leaders to promote \"the breadth and depth of British expertise in technology, infrastructure, and financial and professional services,\" Downing Street says.Mrs May begins her trip to Africa in her country's largest trading partner on the continent, South Africa, where she will sit down with President Cyril Ramaphosa. She will use a speech in Cape Town on Tuesday to lay out her plans to partner with Africa using private sector trade and investment after the United Kingdom leaves the EU.\"The UK has long been an important trading partner for South Africa and certainly in the current economic climate, where many South African businesses are struggling, numerous entrepreneurs are looking to the UK to expand their reach,\" Rachel Irvine, who runs a public relations and marketing agency, told the BBC. She has recently expanded her business, Irvine Partners, in London and sees significant potential in the prime minister's visit. But she says that it is ultimately about which country offers the best deals.'We welcome both Mrs May and the Chinese, and like any other developing economy we'll do the business that suits us best.\"The prime minister's trip comes a week before the huge Forum on China-Africa Cooperation in Beijing. Dozens of African heads of state are expected there and China may offer new trade and finance deals.The summit comes after Chinese President Xi Jinping's second tour of Africa when he visited Senegal, Rwanda, Mauritius and South Africa. Mrs May's trip seems rather low key in comparison.The British prime minister is also set to meet Nigerian President Muhammadu Buhari in Abuja, just four months after they held talks in London. Nigeria is Britain's second largest trading partner in Africa, but should the country be so focused on the UK?Tunji Andrews, an economist based in Nigeria's commercial hub Lagos, believes Nigeria should concentrate more on its relationship with the European Union. \"The diversity of demand of the EU market makes it slightly more attractive.\"I think it's impossible not to look at the British market at this point, but I'll also say that while Britain remains a viable trade partner, it just doesn't hold the same value to Africa as China and to a lesser extent, the US.\"Nigeria's top export to the UK is crude oil and its largest import is refined oil, a structural inefficiency that leads to regular fuel shortages as the populous West African nation lacks a properly functioning refinery. Mrs May concludes her maiden African trip in Kenya, becoming the first British prime minister to visit the East African country in over 30 years.The country re-exports some of its products to the EU through the UK and there are concerns that a hard Brexit might jeopardise that. Kenya's trade split between the UK and the rest of the EU \"is almost 50-50 and the country will have to strike a good deal with both the UK and the EU because it depends on both markets to sell its tea, fresh produce and other agricultural products,\" says economist Tony Watima. Kenya supplies more roses to the European Union than any other country and is the world's third largest exporter of cut flowers. The country sends 17% of its flowers sold in the EU to the UK. With 500,000 people supported by the flower industry, according to the Kenya Flower Council, every market is critical.But with direct flights from Nairobi to New York beginning in October, the country may be looking to tap into the larger US market for its goods. President Uhuru Kenyatta will meet Mrs May in Nairobi on Thursday just three days after discussing trade with US President Donald Trump at the White House.  Overall, there is a sense that Africa is being wooed from many sides.Mrs May's trip to the continent is part of her mission to create a \"truly Global Britain\". She goes with the hope of offering a new partnership in which both the UK and Africa can benefit, but there are those who want the continent to drive a hard bargain.\"Markets are global, why should Africa have to pick just one?\" asks South African businesswoman Rachel Irvine. \"It is therefore decidedly in the interest of both parties to play nice with each other.\"",

            "title": "Reuters journalists jailed in Myanmar over secrets act",
            "content": "A court in Myanmar has sentenced two Reuters journalists to seven years in prison for violating a state secrets act while investigating violence against the Rohingya minority. Wa Lone and Kyaw Soe Oo, nationals of Myanmar, were arrested while carrying official documents which had just been given to them by police officers.They have maintained their innocence, saying they were set up by police. The case has been widely seen as a test of press freedom in Myanmar.\"I have no fear,\" Wa Lone said after the verdict. \"I have not done anything wrong. I believe in justice, democracy and freedom.\"The two men, who both have families with young children, have been in prison since their arrest in December 2017. Wa Lone, 32, and Kyaw Soe Oo, 28, are Myanmar citizens who were working for the international news agency.They had been collecting evidence about the murders of 10 Rohingya men by the army in the village of Inn Din in northern Rakhine in September 2017. They were arrested before the report's publication, after being handed some documents by two policemen who they met at the restaurant for the first time. A police witness testified during the trial that the restaurant meeting was a set-up to entrap the journalists.The final report - a collaboration with other colleagues - was considered extraordinary, because it gathered testimonies from a range of participants, including Buddhist villagers who confessed to killing Rohingya Muslims and torching their homes. Accounts from paramilitary police also directly implicated the military. The military had previously released its own investigation into allegations of abuse in Rakhine, and exonerated itself of all wrongdoing. Authorities later launched their own probe into the Inn Din killings, confirming the massacre took place and promising to take action against those who had taken part.At least 700,000 Rohingya have fled violence in the country in the past year. The crisis erupted when a brutal crackdown was launched in response to a Rohingya militant group attacking several police posts. The United Nations has called the army's response - including murder, torture, rape, sexual slavery, persecution and enslavement - \"grossly disproportionate to actual security threats\". A UN report - released last week - called for military leaders to face genocide charges for their actions. Myanmar rejected the report. It sees the Rohingya - who have their own culture and language - as illegal immigrants from Bangladesh.Judge Ye Lwin told the court in Yangon the pair had \"intended to harm the interests of the state\".  \"And so they have been found guilty under the state secrets act,\" he said.The verdict had been delayed once because of the judge's ill health.Nick Beake, BBC Myanmar correspondent, YangonWa Lone and Kyaw Soe Oo bowed their heads as the verdict was delivered, while their families broke down in tears in court. The reporters have always insisted they were framed. Wa Lone - who missed the birth of his first child while being detained - protested his innocence once again as he was led away. Many will see this verdict as a crushing blow to freedom of the press in Myanmar and another setback for democracy, three years after Aung San Suu Kyi's party triumphed in free elections. Last week, UN inspectors called for Myanmar's top generals to stand trial for genocide for the crimes committed against the Rohingya - the very subject these reporters were investigating. \"Today is a sad day for Myanmar, Reuters journalists Wa Lone and Kyaw Soe Oo, and press freedom anywhere,\" Reuters editor-in-chief Stephen Adler said. The verdict has been widely criticised by observers and human rights groups.  \"We are extremely disappointed by this verdict,\" Britain's ambassador to Myanmar, Dan Chugg, said according to Reuters.US ambassador Scot Marciel echoed the same criticism, saying the court's decision was \"deeply troubling for everybody who has struggled so hard here for media freedom\".The UN's resident and humanitarian co-ordinator in Myanmar, Knut Ostby, said the UN had \"consistently called for the release\" of the journalists and that \"a free press is essential for peace, justice and human rights for all. We are disappointed by today's court decision\".A free press is essential for peace, justice and human rights for all. We are disappointed by today’s court decision.

            "title": "India Assam: 'I won't die before I prove my Indian citizenship'",
            "content": "Some 1,000 people have been sent to detention centres in India's north-eastern state of Assam after being declared illegal citizens. BBC Hindi's Nitin Srivastava reports on what life has been like for some of them. Ajit Das, 33, fears he may never recover from the three months he spent in a detention camp in the city of Silchar. He was granted bail a few weeks ago to help his wife care for their four-year-old daughter, who is autistic. During his time in the camp, Mr Das lost his job, his health deteriorated and his wife spent a large portion of their savings to visit him regularly.\"I lost 5kg in three months. The food was awful and often half-cooked,\" he says.Mr Das was sent to the detention camp after he was declared an illegal citizen by a special court set up to identify illegal immigrants from neighbouring Bangladesh. Since 1985, these special courts have heard some 85,000 cases of people suspected of being foreigners by India's border police. They have reached decisions on the cases of at least 1,000 people, who are now in six detention centres across Assam. The government is yet to release information on the status of the remaining cases. Illegal migration from Bangladesh to India's north-east, including Assam, has always been a serious concern. Estimates of illegal foreigners range from four million to 10 million - and they have a sizeable presence in at least 15 of Assam's 33 districts. Most of them are engaged in agriculture.Mr Das says his parents arrived from Bangladesh in the 1960s and they died a few years ago. He says he was born in India but the court classified him as a \"doubtful Indian citizen\", claiming that his documents did not prove it. Although the citizenship of Mr Das's wife has not been questioned, their two children have been found to be illegal citizens. The couple have hired a lawyer to challenge the government's decision but Mr Das says that is costing them a lot of money. Although those who have been declared foreigners can appeal the decision, it will be a lengthy process that could take months or even years. Until they get a final decision on their legal status, Mr Das and his family will have to live in limbo. However it is unclear what will happen to them even if they lose the appeal as India has no official treaty with Bangladesh in relation to cross-border illegal immigration.Earlier this month, the Indian government published a list of Assam's proven citizens, which left out the names of some four million people. This has complicated the situation further as the government is yet to clarify if the two processes overlap in any way. Meanwhile, Mr Das is afraid that his bail might be cancelled at any time, forcing him to return to the camp.  He says the camp was a large but cramped room in a red building that houses a prison. All the detention camps in Assam are located within a prison compound. Mr Das recalls at least 35 people eating and sleeping in the single room that was the Silchar camp. And they all used one toilet which had no locks - they waited for 30 minutes every morning for their turn.  He was woken up each morning at 05:00 (23:30 GMT) by a thunderous shout. He had to be ready within the hour or he would miss the daily cup of tea served with two biscuits. Everyone was then ushered out of the room to spend the day out in the open ground surrounded by 40ft (12m) high brick walls.Lunch comprised of rice, pulses and a vegetable, while dinner was hurriedly served before 17:00. They had to return indoors by 18:00, after which the doors would be locked. Outside the camp, people can be seen queuing through the day to meet family members who were inside the walls. Most of them will meet for just 10 minutes, separated by a row of thick iron rods. Those who can afford it buy themselves some extra time. Mohammed Yunus (his name has been changed on his request) says he has visited his father in the Silchar camp every week since he was sent there a year ago. \"Despite having the right to vote and owning a small piece of land, we are forced to prove our citizenship in court,\" he says. Some people have been declared foreigners due to bureaucratic errors - such as Suchandra Goswami, a part-time music instructor.She received a legal notice in 2011 to prove her citizenship. She says she did not respond since her first name was misspelt. But in 2015, she was arrested. She was in prison for three days before she was able to secure bail. \"Three days in prison for a spelling error was enough to destroy my confidence in everything,\" says Ms Goswami. \"I was sobbing for three nights.\" Ms Goswami says she was placed in a regular prison, not a detention camp. Mr Das, too, says he was first put in a prison cell with people who \"were serving time for murder or rape\" and he was moved to the detention centre only after he complained.  India's Supreme Court recently asked both the federal and state governments to submit reports on living conditions in the camps.\"Some [of those identified as \"doubtful citizens\"] have had to stay with prisoners in a common jail because of space constraints,\" S Lakshmanan, a district official, told BBC Hindi. \"But we are committed to improving living conditions. We provide free medical aid and we are in the process of overcoming staff shortages.\"Chandradhar Das, who claims he is more than 100 years old, could not escape the detention camp either. And he can barely walk without support.But his name made it to the \"doubtful Indian citizen\" category and despite his age, he spent three months in a camp. He says he managed with the help of others in the camp. \"I won't die before I prove my Indian citizenship,\" he says. ",

            "title": "China education: Why some mothers want August C-sections",
            "content": "Chinese media have noticed a trend of pregnant women rushing to have Caesarean sections before the end of August, so that their yet-to-be-born children will be in the academic year ahead of September-born babies.The state-owned China News Service (CNS) has released a video featuring a \"busy scene\" of pregnant women at a hospital in the central city of Wuhan. The video prompted thousands of social media comments about Chinese attitudes towards childbirth.The government wants to promote natural births in line with its relaxed child policy. It fears that women who have a Caesarean for their first baby could have complications if they go on to have more children.It is also well documented in China that parents feel pressured to ensure that their child has the competitive edge and are anxious for their children to begin academic learning as soon as possible.The issue has prompted an online debate about Chinese parents' attitude towards education, with concerns being voiced about the social pressures placed on children to succeed before they are even born.By Sean Coughlan, BBC News education correspondentThe evidence from UK research, and highlighted by reports including from MPs, has consistently been that summer-born children do less well in exams.There have even been calls for summer-born children to be given extra marks to make up for the disadvantage - and some parents have campaigned to hold their summer-born children back so they start school a year later.The most common explanation is that children born in the summer are less physically and mentally developed than many classmates when they start school in the autumn.A child born in late August is almost a year younger than a classmate born in early September.Despite the age difference, they compete in the same exams - and the attainment gap for summer-born children persists right through school, up to the age of 16.Studies have shown that summer-born children are much more likely to be placed in lower-ability groups.Starting school earlier also does not seem to mean getting further ahead. Finland is often mentioned as a world leader in education - but formal education does not start there until the age of seven. But children soon catch up and overtake countries where pupils have been in school several years earlier.Major hospitals in Wuhan have seen a rush of expectant mothers in their obstetrics and gynaecology wards, CNS reported on Wednesday.It said the number of pregnant women visiting local hospitals was 30% higher than would be expected.One doctor, Song Xiaohui, told CNS \"some [mothers] have made appointments on 31 August in case they cannot have a baby before 1 September via vaginal delivery\".CNS said doctors had been advising most of the women to have natural births, saying that premature births might lead to a child having underdeveloped lungs and breathing difficulties in later life.But that hasn't deterred some parents from trying to seek a C-section.One parent-to-be, Mr Wang, told CNS he felt his first child had experienced \"problems with delayed schooling\" as a result of being born in September.\"Because we had already encountered this kind of problem with one child, we thought hard about our second child,\" he said. \"It has more or less affected our way of thinking. Children should be born before September.\" CNS said that despite the efforts by some parents to have babies by C-section, most women at the Wuhan hospital were \"more willing to wait for a natural birth\".Caesareans have long been favoured in China as a more advanced and less painful way of delivering a child but the abolition of the one-child policy in October 2015 has prompted the state to encourage people to have natural births.The National Family Commission warned in 2016 that women who chose Caesareans for their first birth could have complications with later pregnancies.Caesarean procedures carry a slightly higher risk than natural births and can cause a ruptured uterus, or a low-lying placenta, both of which risk causing complications for future pregnancies.Although CNS says that choosing to select the timing of a birth has only become a common phenomenon in recent years, Chinese women have long been selective about when they choose to have children, with certain times being regarded as inauspicious.In 2014, it was widely reported that some women were rushing to have children before 2015 - the year of the sheep. Couples were anxious that if they had sheep babies, they would grow up to be followers, rather than leaders.But striving to have a child before September is a relatively modern phenomenon, with state-run Xinhua News Agency saying that it leaves parents feeling they have \"won time\" regarding their child's education.Some social media users are extremely critical of women trying to have premature births for the reason of academic achievement.Thousands of users of the popular Sina Weibo microblog are discussing the phenomenon, with some saying that a woman's body is her own and that she has the right to choose.But many users say the trend is \"crazy\" and shows the way in which Chinese parents are putting too much pressure on their children.\"Do people nowadays no longer care about the health of a foetus?\" one user asks. \"A full-term birth is more conducive to a baby's health.\"\"This is insane - that society is so eager for quick success,\" another adds.\"A child is not yet born, but he's already being placed on the starting line,\" one user says.\"The system is ridiculous, and these women are ridiculous,\" another adds.Many social media users say they think China's competitive education system is to blame, and some fear the impact on infant health.\"Premature births can have an impact on a child's intelligence,\" one user notes.Another user adds they think the trend is inherently \"Chinese\". \"Our system is not human,\" they say.BBC Monitoring reports and analyses news from TV, radio, web and print media around the world.

            "title": "China congress: How authorities censor your thoughts",
            "content": "If you control public communication you can control the way people think and how they behave. That's what Xi Jinping's government is counting on.And it is never more true than at the time of major political gatherings.The Communist Party Congress, held every five years, is set to begin next week: an event which will culminate in the revelation of the new leadership team behind General Secretary Xi.So the censors here are poised to restrict with one hand and disseminate with the other.What they're looking out for are key words and expressions popping up in social media. Anything signalling an intention to protest or ridiculing the country's senior political figures will be blocked and potentially see a user reported to the authorities.For example, a message featuring the name of this country's ever-more powerful leader and his sometimes-used nickname \"Winnie the Pooh\" (小熊维尼) will simply not go through to group discussions on the messaging app WeChat.Funny stickers featuring Mr Xi or previous Chinese leaders also can't be sent to chat groups.China has all the appearances of an increasingly open society: flashy new cities with Hollywood movies advertised on bus stops; digital currency taken up like nowhere else; cool kids getting around on hire bikes zooming through a gleaming modern existence.And yet, since Mr Xi came to power five years ago, public discourse has been increasingly censored to try and control everything from political thought to sexual activity.In the lead up to the Olympic Games in 2008, it felt as if freedom of expression was ever on the rise here.New laws allowed foreign reporters to travel around the country without specific permission from local governments. It's hard to believe it, but Google searches were not blocked then. Investigative journalism from local Chinese publications - like the Southern Weekend newspaper and Caijing magazine - was becoming as good as anywhere in the world.I remember being at a function where a group of journalists were speaking to one of the foreign affairs ministry spokespeople. We had some concern or other, and he was reassuring us that everything would be all right.\"Don't worry,\" he said, smiling as he pushed an imaginary truck gear into position. \"In China we only have one gear, and it's forward.\"It sometimes doesn't feel like that now.\"You can't control the internet,\" is something people would say in those years - part mantra, part celebration of a new global reality.But Chinese officials have worked out that actually, you can.Rather than connecting to the internet, this country has something more like an intranet within the boundaries of the Great Firewall of China. Sites like Amnesty International, Facebook, and Twitter are unreachable for most Chinese, unless they have use of a virtual private network (VPN), which effectively punts their computer over the Great Firewall.So, with the congress approaching, there's been an assault on VPN use. The government has ordered Apple to remove all VPNs from its Chinese app store.The company has decided in favour of not being kicked out of this enormous market and is doing what Beijing wants.Years ago Google was given a similar ultimatum: allow Chinese officials to censor search results or you're gone. Google didn't cave in, and was blocked.China's most effective censorship tool is also the country's most widespread method of communication.Pretty much everybody here uses the phone app WeChat. It has text messaging, group chats, photo sharing, location searching and electronic payments.During periods of political sensitivity - like now - key words will trigger the blocking or monitoring of a post. If sensitive enough, they could even lead to state security knocking on your door.New regulations also make a person who sets up a group chat responsible for what's said amongst the group.As you can imagine, the administrators of football team chats might be feeling a little nervous about the content of late night posts from drunken players.Some will wonder how this is all possible as the app is not owned by the government but run by the hugely-powerful Chinese company Tencent. Well, under new regulations from the Cyber Administration of China, private entities which run these platforms are required to not only enforce content restrictions but also report those who violate them to the \"relevant authorities\".For many Chinese people - even those overseas - WeChat has also become their main news feed. If you restrict this content you can close out certain news coverage.Potential challengers to WeChat's virtual monopoly are also being reined in. WhatsApp is not 100% within the domain of the Chinese state.So, at times in recent weeks, its use has been impossible to reach without a VPN.It is not clear whether the disruption of WhatsApp is a temporary measure to coincide with the congress or yet another restriction that's here to stay.It is no secret that every Chinese newspaper and television station is under the complete control of the Communist Party.And yet last year, when Mr Xi visited the People's Daily newspaper, Xinhua wire service and state broadcaster CCTV, he still demanded the absolute loyalty of reporters who should follow the Party's leadership in \"politics, thought and action\".But, just in case some journalists didn't get the memo, a set of rules have been sent around governing coverage of this year's congress, requiring all interviews with experts or scholars to be approved by the outlet's \"work unit leadership\" and the central propaganda department.However, China's censorship and propaganda model is also going beyond sensitive political matters. Online bookstores must now work under a rating system from the State Administration of Press, Publication, Radio, Film and Television which includes the promotion of \"moral values\".Popular blogs focusing on celebrity scandals and the intrigues of the rich and famous have been forced to close.To talk about such matters has been deemed to be not in keeping with \"core socialist values\".For a time, cheap online video dramas were pushing out the boundaries of what could be viewed here. There was a gay sitcom, for example. But digital platforms have been ordered to stop showing hundreds of foreign shows, and their locally produced material is expected to follow the same restrictions as television.As it is, on Chinese TV you rarely see anything approaching a passionate kiss. Two years ago a TV drama was forced to reframe and zoom in on its shots so as to crop out the generous cleavage of its 7th Century maidens, in order to remain on air.Thus goes the creeping imposition of a state-sanctioned morality under Mr Xi's administration.Last month, TV dramas were given notice of a new set of rules governing their content. They should \"enhance people's cultural taste\" and \"strengthen spiritual civilisation\". Directors are supposed to come up with engaging characters beyond the realms of lewd behaviour, extra-marital affairs, gambling, drugs, homosexuality and other forms of \"immoral\" behaviour.The notice suggested eulogising the Communist Party of China, the country, the people and also national heroes. And one figure is emerging via the propaganda machine to stand head and shoulders above all others.As the censors shut down dissent, the party is urging a way of thinking about all that's good in China and tracing it back to a single source - Xi Jinping.An exhibition focusing on the recent achievements of the Chinese government has opened in Beijing.Vast rooms are dedicated to science, transport, the military, the economy, sport, ethnic minorities, and they are all dominated by massive photos of Xi Jinping. There must be hundreds of them.The English language newspaper China Daily has been rolling out a series of front page stories - one every day - about the \"impact of\" a visit from Mr Xi on various villages, towns and cities after the General Secretary passed on his advice.\"He asked people to protect the lake\", \"President Xi proposed moving people in the villages to the new settlement\", \"Xi emphasised the importance of afforestation\", et cetera.Some here are joking that this type of reporting is not all that far from what you might expect in the North Korean press describing its own god-like leaders.When Chinese officials make speeches now, they refer to this or that aspect of what they're up to \"with Xi Jinping at the core\".It goes without saying that you cannot question \"the core\" without this nation's considerable censorship apparatus crashing down upon you.But, short of such an obvious breach, the rules regarding what can and can't be said, broadcast, forwarded, analysed are thought to be kept deliberately vague. In this way, everyone is on their toes and the authorities can shut down what they like at any time without having to give a reason.Editors, cartoonists, reporters, directors, bloggers, comedians, administrators running social media platforms and ordinary Chinese citizens posting to their friends are all staying well clear of certain subjects just in case it lands them in hot water.In short: Chinese censorship works, and plenty of other governments around the world are looking on with admiration.",

            "title": "Sandy Hook families v Alex Jones: Defamation case explained",
            "content": "The parents of a 2012 mass shooting victim can sue Infowars host and conspiracy theorist Alex Jones for defamation, a Texas judge has ruled. Mr Jones sought to dismiss the suit brought by the parents of a boy killed in the Sandy Hook school massacre. Leonard Pozner and Veronique De La Rosa allege they were harassed and forced to move after Mr Jones decried the attack that left 26 dead as a left-wing hoax.The case is one of five defamation lawsuits he is facing. Mr Jones argued that he was protected from the lawsuit by his first amendment free speech rights under the US constitution. He also sought more than $100,000 (£77,000) in court costs from the couple. But Judge Scott Jenkins of Travis County, Texas rejected Mr Jones' argument and his motion to dismiss the lawsuit, according to court papers.  Alex Jones is the founder and host of Infowars - a far-right radio and online show that is best known as a platform for Mr Jones' conspiracy theories.After the Sandy Hook Elementary School shooting that left 20 young children and six adults dead in 2012, he repeatedly described the incident as a hoax on his show.He alleged the massacre was \"completely fake\", using actors and staged by the government in order to promote its agenda for nationwide gun control. Mr Jones has faced criticism before for similar claims, including his claim that the 9/11 attacks were also staged by the government.Infowars touts millions of listeners and viewers. Mr Jones has also interviewed President Donald Trump, who has repeated Infowars claims on his Twitter feed and in speeches.More than five years after Sandy Hook, the parents of Noah Pozner - who was six years old when he was shot and killed - are suing Mr Jones for defamation. Mr Pozner and Ms De La Rosa are suing Mr Jones in Travis County, where Mr Jones is based.Last April, Mr Jones posted a video titled \"Sandy Hook Vampires Exposed\", which implied Ms De La Rosa was an actor. This video is at the centre of the parents' case, as defamation claims in certain states have a one-year statute of limitations.The family's legal action also followed an incident in which a Florida woman who believed Mr Jones' claims began making death threats against Mr Pozner.Mark Bankston, the lawyer for the Pozner family, says his clients are suing Mr Jones because they believe he has no intention of leaving them alone.The judge has yet to rule on a second defamation case against Mr Jones, brought by Neil Heslin, the father of slain Sandy Hook student Jesse Lewis.Mr Heslin's complaint alleges that Mr Jones accused him of lying about holding his son's body with a bullet hole in his head.On Infowars, Mr Jones has said the defamation case is \"all out of context\".His defence argues first and second amendment rights as they ask for the lawsuit to be thrown out. The first amendment in the US constitution guarantees free speech; the second affords the right to bear arms.The media mogul's defence team claims that it is his constitutional right to invent stories and that no reasonable person would take Mr Jones' words as fact.Mr Jones has also implied that the parents are actors seeking to undermine laws allowing private gun ownership.His lawyer Mark Enoch claims the lawsuit is attacking the second amendment by targeting Mr Jones' free speech rights, according to the Austin-American Statesman newspaper.He said the lawsuit was part of the parents' public campaign \"to outlaw conspiracy theories, assault rifles, high-capacity clips and to increase firearm registration requirements\".As a part of his argument, Mr Enoch also says that the Pozners are operating as public figures, just as Mr Jones is, which means to prove defamation, they must also prove \"actual malice\".To win, a plaintiff must prove that the defendant made a false statement of fact about them and that they suffered harm as a result.In addition, most states have a statute of limitations of one to three years for bringing any defamation cases.If the plaintiff is a public figure - a film star or politician - they must prove that the person making the false statement acted intentionally or with reckless disregard for the truth, known as \"actual malice\".\"What makes things trickier, however, is that the law has a concept of a 'limited-purpose public figure,'\" litigator Devon Holstad told the BBC. \"This definition is hard to describe, but it pertains to people who are ordinary citizens but may be well known because of a specific issue or within a certain following of people.\"This is one of the arguments that Alex Jones is making - that the parents are public figures because they speak publicly on issues such as gun violence,\" Mr Holstad says.Texas-based media lawyer Marc Fuller told the BBC that if the parents do have to prove actual malice, it can be difficult to win.\"Showing that a defendant either knowingly lied or was reckless about the truth of his or her statement is a high standard, particularly in cases involving mainstream news reporting,\" Mr Fuller says. \"In addition, the first amendment protects opinion and rhetorical hyperbole, both of which are commonly at issue where the alleged defamation was published in social media or non-traditional media.\"In an era of fake news and social media, this suit may have an impact on future free speech claims, especially those concerning social media figures.\"Alex Jones is obviously an extreme case, but I do think that we are seeing an increase in politically-charged defamation cases,\" Mr Fuller told the BBC.\"These types of cases will continue to present interesting issues relating to the consequences of participating in public debate and how to draw the line between fact and opinion in those debates.\"This case has already had an impact on various social platforms. Apple, YouTube, Facebook and Spotify all deleted Infowars content in recent weeks, citing hate speech.Earlier this month, Twitter banned Mr Jones for a week, but has come under fire for refusing to close his account.But technology companies continue to grapple with regulation and free speech in social media-driven cases. \"One thing social media has done is give more people the ability to make statements to a broader audience,\" Mr Holstad says. \"This will be one area of important development for first amendment law in the years to come.\"",

            "title": "Russia's Putin softens pension reforms after outcry",
            "content": "Russian leader Vladimir Putin has softened planned pension changes following angry protests and a slump in his approval rating.He said the retirement age for women would be increased from 55 to 60 instead of to 63. But a five-year increase for men, to 65, would stay. In a rare TV address, Mr Putin said the country's working-age population was shrinking, making change essential.Unions have warned that many will not live long enough to claim a pension.Russian men have a life expectancy of 66 while for women it is 77, the World Health Organization says.The issue has seen support for Mr Putin fall to 64% from 80%, according to VTsIOM state pollster. Mr Putin said the move to raise the retirement age for men and women had been delayed for years and risked causing inflation and increasing poverty.Postponing it further would threaten the stability and security of Russian society, he said.\"Any further delay would be irresponsible,\" he said.\"Our decisions should be just and well-balanced,\" he added.Until his TV address he had attempted to distance himself from the row, and had in the past promised that the pension age would never be raised on his watch.Under the new plan, to be implemented from 2019, the retirement age for men will be increased gradually from 60 to 65.Before Mr Putin's intervention women were to have to work another eight years from 55 to 63 - their planned retirement age has now been reduced to 60.Mr Putin said that Russia \"cherished women\".\"Women not only work but they also take care of the house and children and grandchildren. Their retirement age should not increase by more than that of men,\" he said.Women with three or more children could retire earlier, he added.Prime Minister Dmitry Medvedev has previously said the decision was motivated by the fact that Russians are living longer and leading more active lives.He said there were 12 million working pensioners in Russia, equal to nearly a quarter of all pensioners.Tens of thousands have rallied across Russia in recent weeks.\"Help the state, die before your pension,\" read one home-made placard in the Siberian city of Omsk in early July, where about 3,000 people turned out. \"The government must go,\" read another.This activist posted photos from a protest in Komsomolsk-on-Amur in Russia's far-eastern region in early July.Unusually for Russia, protesters have been from all sides of the political debate.Communist Party red flags and nationalist banners flew side by side, and opposition supporters joined in too.The initial announcement was made at the same time as the World Cup in Russia began, prompting criticism that the Russian government was trying to bury bad news.Most economists and many Russians agree there is a problem. The population is getting older and the state is spending more and more on pensions.After the economic chaos of the early 1990s, Russia's population plummeted. The birth rate has since shown some signs of improvement, but it is not happening fast enough.Based on current trends, 20% of Russians will be over 65 by 2050, says the UN.President Putin has just signed a new bill on pension spending, envisaging a deficit of more than 265bn roubles (£3.1bn; $4.2bn) in 2018. That's 1.6% of the entire state budget expenditure.It is clearly not a sustainable situation, especially in tough economic times.",

            "content": "The government of Nicaraguan President Daniel Ortega has ordered a team from the United Nations Commission for Human Rights to leave.The expulsion comes days after a critical report into human rights in Nicaragua during months of anti-government protests.The chief of the UN mission, Guillermo Fernandez, said his team would continue to monitor the situation from abroad. More than 300 people were killed during the recent political unrest.The report released on Wednesday by the UN High Commissioner for Human Rights called on the government to stop the persecution of protestors and disarm masked gangs who it alleges are responsible for killings and arbitrary detentions. It also described the torture and use of excessive force using interviews with victims and local human rights groups.For its part, the government said the report was biased and ignored attacks by protesters on members of the governing Sandinista party. President Ortega had invited the UN team to help monitor a national dialogue process between the government and the protestors which stalled.He said earlier this week that the UN had overstepped its authority and was violating Nicaragua's national sovereignty.",

            "title": "John McCain: Obama and Bush pay tribute at Washington service",
            "content": "Ex-presidents Barack Obama and George W Bush have paid tribute to Senator John McCain at a memorial service at Washington's National Cathedral.The Vietnam War hero, who became one of America's most high-profile politicians, died a week ago from brain cancer at the age of 81.His daughter Meghan was the first to speak, paying an emotional tribute to her father while also criticising President Donald Trump's agenda.Mr Trump did not attend the service.The two Republicans had major differences, both personal and political, and Mr McCain's family made it clear that Mr Trump was not welcome.Members of the Trump administration who were present included the president's daughter Ivanka and son-in-law Jared Kushner. Following memorial services in the state of Arizona - which Mr McCain represented as a senator, and where he died last Saturday - and in Washington, a private burial service will be held at the US Naval Academy in Annapolis, Maryland, on Sunday.On Friday Mr McCain's body was taken back to the Congress buildings where he worked for decades and lay in state in the Capitol rotunda overnight.On the way from the Capitol to the cathedral on Saturday morning, the cortege stopped at the Vietnam Veterans Memorial, where his widow Cindy laid a wreath.Meghan McCain told mourners at the cathedral: \"We gather here to mourn the passing of American greatness.\"The real thing, not cheap rhetoric from men who will never come near the sacrifice he gave so willingly, nor the opportunistic appropriation of those who live lives of comfort and privilege while he suffered and served.\"The America of John McCain is generous and welcoming and bold, she is resourceful and confident and secure, she meets her responsibilities, she speaks quietly because she is strong. \"America does not boast, because she does not need to. The America of John McCain has no need to be made great again, because America was always great.\"Former President Obama paid tribute to the man he defeated in the 2008 US presidential election.He described Mr McCain as an \"extraordinary man - a warrior, a statesman, a patriot\" who embodied much of what made America great.Mr Obama said that, despite their many differences, \"we never doubted we were on the same team\".He added: \"John understood that our security and our influence was won not just by our military might, not just by our wealth, not just by our ability to bend others to our will, but from our capacity to inspire others with our adherence to a set of universal values - like rule of law and human rights - and an insistence on the God-given dignity of every human being.\"Mr Bush - who defeated Mr McCain for the Republican presidential nomination in 2000 - paid tribute to the senator's courage, honesty and sense of honour.\"At various points during his long career, John confronted polices and practices that he believed were unworthy of his country. To the face of those in authority, John McCain would insist: 'We are better than this, America is better than this.'\"John would be the first to tell you he was not a perfect man, but he dedicated his life to national ideals that are as perfect as men and women have as yet conceived.\"Other speakers included former Senator Joe Lieberman and former Secretary of State Henry Kissinger, 95.Before he went into politics, Mr McCain was a US Navy pilot who was shot down over Hanoi while on a bombing mission in 1967.He was held as a prisoner until 1973, enduring torture that - along with the injuries he sustained bailing out of his jet - left him with life-long injuries.While deeply conservative on some issues, the Arizona senator had a maverick streak that endeared him to political friends and opponents.He championed reform of US immigration, campaign finance and environmental laws, and was outspoken in criticising those who advocated what he considered torture against captured enemies of the US.The pallbearers he chose reflected his desire to reach across political divides. They included Hollywood actor and liberal political activist Warren Beatty; former independent New York City Mayor Michael Bloomberg; liberal former Senator Russ Feingold, who drew up campaign finance reform legislation with McCain; and Russian opposition politician Vladimir Kara Murza.",

            "title": "Obituary: Rosa Bouglione, the undisputed queen of the circus",
            "content": "When Rosa Bouglione was married inside a lion's cage, the pastor, despite his best efforts, was made to stay outside. It wouldn't have been much of a wedding had he been mauled.It was only appropriate that this was where Rosa had chosen to be married. After all, she had started her career inside a lion's cage, working as a serpentine dancer, in her mid-teens.This was the circus life into which she was born, in the back of a horse-drawn caravan in Belgium in December 1910. Her father was an animal trainer with the family outfit, Ménagerie Van Been, and they toured Europe alongside their snakes, bears and lions.\"I was born in a caravan, and that's where I left my heart,\" Rosa would later write in her autobiography. Aged 17, however, there was another contender for her heart: she fell for a man from another circus family, Joseph Bouglione, whom she said reminded her of a cowboy, and the two were married among the lions.Their honeymoon was as unusual as their wedding - they spent it working with the troupe of the Wild West Show, established by hunter and showman Buffalo Bill Cody.Rosa's life after joining the Bouglione family brought her close to France's high society and made her a household name, even if attitudes towards the circus began to change in her later years.Rosa Bouglione died in Paris on Sunday, 26 August aged 107.Her funeral on Wednesday took place in the ring of the Cirque d'Hiver (Winter Circus), the 1,500-person venue in the Marais district which she and her husband's family took over in 1934.The grand circular building, commissioned by Napoleon III, remained the Bouglione family's base, even as they, their animals, clowns and performers travelled the world. It was a life that Joseph Bouglione said was like a constant holiday.In an interview in 2011, Rosa recalled one trip to Brazil, on which they were accompanied by 30 horses, 10 lions, six tigers and a polar bear, among other animals.When the captain of the ship carrying them tried to throw the circus' elephants overboard to reduce the ship's weight during a storm, Joseph threatened to organise a mutiny and so the crew tossed away much of the cargo instead.Running the circus was a feat of logistics: 100 trucks full of animals and equipment would have to be unloaded and then reloaded in a day, and 40 tonnes of cloth packed up tidily at the end of each show.And then there was the small matter of managing the animals themselves. There was Jacky the gorilla, who would drink only Perrier water and would make hammocks out of the curtains of any hotels where the troupe stayed.There was the anaconda which would squeeze the most attractive women a little tighter than the others. There was Coco, the foul-mouthed parrot who would fly to the balcony and scream \"Help!\" so loudly the police would come rushing round.Even as one of the biggest names in the circus world, the family was not always welcome on its travels, as Rosa told France's TF1 network in 2011. They were gypsies by origin, and were often treated with suspicion and subject to allegations as they arrived in a new town.\"I never understood it,\" she said. \"People said we'd steal children. But we never did. We had our own children, we didn't need to steal children. But we just let them say this stuff.\"It was the Cirque d'Hiver that provided the platform for some of the family's biggest shows and most notable successes. Among them was La Perle du Bengale, where one performer braved the full force of a whip strike, and damsels in distress fell into pools swarming with snakes.Rosa stopped performing and did more work behind the scenes of the circus, and over time, the venue attracted the biggest names from the entertainment world and regularly hosted live TV specials.The actress, singer and black icon Josephine Baker was one, and soprano Maria Callas another. When Callas once got a little too close to Joseph Bouglione, she was almost crushed by an elephant that was wary of women other than Rosa being around him.Rosa and Joseph eventually brought an end to their life on the road, moving in to a house around the corner from the circus in 1984.Joseph died three years later but Rosa remained there until her death, surrounded by reminders of her career. Among them, the pelt of her pet leopard Mickey, that would sit on top of the dining table, his head still attached, seemingly snarling at any visitors.She would still attend matinees into her old age, and would let the performers know her opinion. \"The shows got bigger and the children got bigger, but I got smaller,\" she said.Entertainment in 2018 is very different to that of the early 20th Century, when Rosa began dancing in the lion's cage.Nowadays, the Cirque d'Hiver is just as well known as a concert venue, or as the setting for political rallies. The industry is also under growing pressure to end the use of live animals - a debate that has arrived in France a little later than in other countries.Before his resignation this week, French environment minister Nicolas Hulot had said he was against the practice, and after the shooting to death of a tiger that had escaped from another Paris circus last November, campaigners renewed their calls for a ban on the use of live animals in shows.In 2016, the Bouglione family announced it would no longer use an ageing elephant in its shows after an environmental group accused the circus of mistreating the animal.But the family is divided about whether animals should still be a part of its performances.Last May, one of Rosa and Joseph's grandsons, André, who founded his own circus, said he would end the practice. \"It's because of my love of animals and out of respect for the public that I stopped this,\" he told the campaign group 30 Millions d'Amis in an interview.\"I saw a survey that said 80% of French people cared about animal rights. Our job is entertaining families. So if a very large majority of families believes this, we can't continue doing something that upsets them.\"But another grandson, Francesco, who is now the director of the Cirque d'Hiver, has vowed to continue using animals and has condemned what he calls \"eco-terrorism\".He told the Journal du Dimanche newspaper last year: \"We're tired of being tainted by false claims, without mentioning the protests in front of our tents and acts of sabotage. This won't end well.\"Rosa Bouglione leaves 55 children, grandchildren, great-grandchildren and great-great grandchildren, and a family name which remains above the entrance to the Cirque d'Hiver.In a statement, her family said she was \"the undisputed queen of the circus world\", adding: \"Her passion for the circus stayed with her until the very end.\"A new show honouring Rosa's life, named Extra, will begin at the Cirque d'Hiver on 6 October.

            "content": "Two Malaysian women convicted of attempting to have lesbian sex in a car have been caned in a religious court.The Muslim women, aged 22 and 32, were each caned six times in the Sharia High Court in the state of Terengganu. According to an official, this is the state's first conviction for same-sex relations and its first public caning.Human rights activists reacted with outrage. Homosexual activity is illegal under both secular and religious laws.The caning was witnessed by more than 100 people, according to local news outlet The Star. Malaysian rights group Women's Aid Organisation told Reuters news agency it was \"appalled by this grave violation of human rights\".A member of the Terengganu state executive council, Satiful Bahri Mamat, defended the punishment, telling the agency it had not been intended to \"torture or injure\" and had been carried out in public to \"serve as a lesson to society\".The duo, whose identities have not been revealed, were arrested in April by Islamic enforcement officers after they were found in a car in a public square in Terengganu. They had last month pleaded guilty to breaking Islamic laws and were sentenced to be caned and fined RM3,300 ($800, £619).\"Sexual acts between two consenting adults should not be criminalised, let alone punished with whipping,\" Women's Aid Organisation said.According to The Star, caning under Islamic law is not similar to caning carried out for crimes under civil law. It is not meant to cause pain.Malaysia is known to be a moderate Muslim-majority country but has seen rising religious sentiment in recent years.Earlier last month, a minister ordered that portraits of LGBT activists be removed from a public exhibition.Malaysia operates a dual-track legal system. Muslims are bound by Sharia - or Islamic - law on personal matters like marriage and custody rights, while members of other faiths follow civil law.",

            "title": "Palestinians fear cost of Trump's refugee agency cut",
            "content": "\"Dignity is priceless,\" read the signs as thousands of employees of the UN agency for Palestinian refugees march through central Gaza City.  They fear Washington's recent decision to withhold $65m (52.5m euros; £46m) - possibly rising to $290m - in funds could affect their positions as well as basic services which most of them, as refugees, rely on. \"Unrwa was there every moment for me,\" says Najwa Sheikh Ahmed, an information officer with the UN Relief and Works Agency.  \"It gave not only food, clothes, education and healthcare but also a job and the opportunity that offers your family.\"  Najwa was born in Khan Younis refugee camp and brought up in tough conditions.She moved to Nuseirat camp when she married her husband, who is also Unrwa staff.  They have five children. When I visit, we pass along narrow streets to the local clinic, painted in the blue and white colours of the UN, so Najwa can get a medical check.  I watch her eldest daughter, Salma, as she excels in an English lesson.  She is one of 270,000 Unrwa students in Gaza.\"As a mother I feel very worried,\" Najwa confides. \"If the funding gap isn't bridged, then Unrwa might find itself in a situation where [it has] to close the schools and health services. My children will be at risk.\"The US is the largest single donor to Unrwa.  Last year, it gave the agency around $360m - about half of the total amount it gave in support to the Palestinians.President Donald Trump first indicated a change in approach on 2 January when he Tweeted that his country got \"no appreciation or respect\" for the large sums of aid it gave.  The State Department insists that freezing Unrwa funds is linked to needed \"reforms\", but suspicions remain that it is meant to punish Palestinian leaders.  They cut ties with the White House weeks earlier after it recognised Jerusalem as Israel's capital.  The Palestinians claim East Jerusalem as the capital of their future state.Last week in Davos, Switzerland, Mr Trump said that aid to the Palestinians would be suspended \"unless they sit down and negotiate peace\".In the impoverished Gaza Strip, which has eight refugee camps, ordinary people complain that they find themselves helplessly caught up in geopolitics.Unrwa was originally set up to take care of hundreds of thousands of Palestinians displaced by the 1948 Arab-Israeli war.  Nearly 70 years on, some of those refugees and many of their descendants continue to live in camps, which are now chronically overcrowded breeze block neighbourhoods.   Unrwa supports some five million people not only in the Palestinian Territories but also in Jordan, Lebanon and Syria - where Palestinian refugees have limited rights. The fate of the refugees is a core issue in the Arab-Israeli conflict and they have often been at the heart of Palestinian political and militant activity.Palestinians call for their \"right to return\" to parts of historic Palestine - land which is now in Israel. Israel rejects that claim and has often criticised the set-up of Unrwa for the way it allows refugee status to be inherited, which it points out is uniquely applied to Palestinians among all the world's refugees.\"How long are we going to have Unrwa? Another 70 years?\" the Prime Minister, Benjamin Netanyahu, said to me at a recent press event.  \"We already have great-great-grandchildren who are refugees - who are not refugees but they're on the list of Unwra.\"Mr Netanyahu suggests donations should be shifted to other humanitarian agencies, including the UN High Commission for Refugees.\"It will have positive effects because the perpetuation of the dream of bringing the descendants back to Jaffa is what sustains this conflict,\" he told me.  \"Unrwa is part of the problem not part of the solution.\"  Unrwa officials stress that the UN General Assembly sets their mandate and dismiss the idea it obstructs any Israel-Palestinian peace deal. \"It is the failure of the political parties to resolve the refugee issue that perpetuates it,\" says Unrwa spokesman Chris Gunness.  \"As soon as there's a resolution of that based on international law, based on United Nations resolutions, Unrwa will go out of business and hand over its service.\"  The agency has now launched a global appeal to fill the gap in its budget and is receiving many messages of support - including from celebrities and 21 international humanitarian groups.Some in Israel also raise concerns that weakening Unrwa could cause regional instability and create more extremism.  \"While Unrwa is far from perfect, the Israeli defence establishment and the Israeli government as a whole, have over the years come to the understanding that all the alternatives are worse for Israel,\" a former Israel Defense Forces (IDF) spokesman, Peter Lerner, wrote in Haaretz newspaper.  At the rally in Gaza City, participants focus on the impact of any Unrwa cutbacks on the most needy but also on existential issues.\"Without Unrwa nobody will identify us as refugees,\" says Najwa Sheikh-Ahmed - whose father fled from his home in al-Majdal - now in Ashkelon in southern Israel - as a boy in 1948.  \"My refugee number, my ration card is witness to the fact that once upon a time I had a homeland,\" she says.  \"Without this we will lose the right to fight for our rights.\"",

            "title": "Viewpoint: Why Trump's threats to Pakistan raise serious questions",
            "content": "On Monday night, President Donald Trump unveiled the long awaited results of his policy review of the Afghanistan war. He announced that US troops would remain in the country without a timetable for withdrawal, with other reports suggesting that 4,000 further troops would be added. This would boost present numbers by around a third, although it would leave the American presence far short of its peak of 100,000 in 2010-11.  But Mr Trump's speech also included two important new elements. He launched a blistering attack on Pakistan, publicly articulating what his predecessors only said in private. \"We have been paying Pakistan billions and billions of dollars at the same time they are housing the very terrorists that we are fighting,\" declared the president. \"It is time for Pakistan to demonstrate its commitment to civilisation, order, and to peace\". This was followed by more threats from Secretary of State Rex Tillerson and the National Security Council spokesman. And if this were not bad enough for Pakistan, Mr Trump then applauded India's \"important contributions to stability in Afghanistan\", urging New Delhi to play a larger role. Since the beginning of the war, Pakistan has allowed the use of its territory to supply international troops in landlocked Afghanistan, tacitly accepted American drones over its airspace, and co-operated with Western intelligence agencies against some terrorist groups like Al Qaeda. However, Pakistan's intelligence agency, the ISI, has also given shelter and support to Afghan insurgents from the 1970s to the present, including the especially virulent Haqqani network. Its aim has been to limit India's influence - but is also influenced by its disagreements with Kabul. Ever since partition, Afghan governments of all stripes have rejected the border known as the Durand Line, laying claim to some Pashtun areas inside Pakistan.  There are three big questions around Trump's approach to Pakistan. The first is whether his words will translate into action. After all, we've been here before. \"We need to make clear to people that the cancer is in Pakistan\", President Barack Obama told advisers in 2009, sending his CIA chief and national security adviser to Islamabad to deliver the message.  \"You can't keep snakes in your backyard and expect them only to bite your neighbours\", warned then Secretary of State Hilary Clinton in 2011. The same year, America's top military officer publicly declared that the Haqqani network was \"a veritable arm\" of Pakistani intelligence. However, these warnings did not translate into action. Pakistan continued to receive around $1bn per year in so-called Coalition Support Funds, as well as other hundreds of millions of dollars in aid. The Trump administration has threatened a range of punishments, including sanctions on Pakistani officials. But will they follow through? This is what Pakistani officials will hope to establish in the coming weeks. The second question is how Pakistan will respond. In past crises, Pakistan has blocked Nato supply routes into Afghanistan, such as the Khyber Pass. There are alternative routes via Iran and Russia-dominated Central Asia, but the Trump administration's relations with Tehran and Moscow are even worse. Beyond this, Pakistan could also shoot American drones out of the sky, ramp up its support for the Taliban, or halt intelligence co-operation entirely. Of course, Pakistan would have to consider the consequences, from losing out on IMF bailouts to provoking open US air strikes.The third question is whether Pakistan can be coerced into abandoning a policy that has taken shape over 40 years. Both Mr Trump and Mr Tillerson declared their openness to peace talks between the Afghan government and the Taliban. Pakistan's concern is that if such talks result in its Taliban allies sharing power in Afghanistan, this would reduce the Taliban's dependence on Pakistan. Taliban leaders who have explored peace talks independently of their Pakistani patrons have ended up arrested or dead. It is possible that Pakistan will decide that it's worth maintaining influence over the Taliban, whatever the cost. Domestically, Pakistan has continued supporting militants despite the death of 20,000 civilians in terrorist attacks over the past 15 years. It's also notable that a meeting of Pakistani military and political leaders on Thursday concluded that the foreign minister should immediately set off on a tour of \"friendly states\", beginning with China. Pakistan is increasingly confident in the support of Beijing, which is investing tens of billions of dollars in the country as part of the ambitious China-Pakistan Economic Corridor (CPEC). However, it's not entirely clear how far China is willing to go to bail out Pakistan, financially or politically.Finally, what should we make of Trump's effort to enlist Indian support? Some critics have argued that this is likely to provoke Pakistan into expanding its support for the Taliban. However, we should bear in mind that the US tried to restrict India's role in Afghanistan through the 2000s, with no positive change in Pakistan's behaviour. Instead, Pakistan is believed to have sponsored the bombing of the Indian embassy in Kabul in 2008, though Islamabad denies this.India expanded its security role in Afghanistan from 2011 onwards, when it signed a strategic partnership with Kabul. It expanded its training of Afghan military officers, 4,000 so far, and gave second-hand attack helicopters to the struggling Afghan National Security Forces (ANSF). This, too, had no apparent impact on Pakistan's policy. We should be realistic about India's potential role. Delhi does not have the capacity to do too much more. It requires co-operation with its old partners Russia or Iran to send military supplies, but both those countries have expanded their own ties with parts of the Taliban in recent years. We should also note that President Trump emphasised India's role in the specific areas of \"economic assistance and development\". This assistance, to the tune of $2bn (£1.56bn), has contributed to India's popularity amongst Afghans. Delhi would not want military support to put that soft power at risk. But on balance, as Western countries focus on terrorist threats from the Middle East and North Africa, and grow more weary of the longest war in their modern history, India's support to a weak Afghan state and its army should probably be welcomed. Update 25 August 2017: The text referring to the bombing of the Indian embassy in Kabul in 2008 has been updated to include Islamabad's denial of involvement.",

            "title": "Should Africa be wary of Chinese debt?",
            "content": "African countries have shown a healthy appetite for Chinese loans but some experts now worry that the continent is gorging on debt, and could soon choke. The Entebbe-Kampala Expressway is still something of a tourist attraction for Ugandans, nearly three months after it opened. The 51km (31 mile), four-lane highway that connects the country's capital to the Entebbe International Airport was built by a Chinese company using a $476m (£366m) loan from the China Exim Bank.It has cut what was a torturous two-hour journey through some of Africa's worst traffic into a scenic 45-minute drive into the East Africa nation's capital.Uganda has taken $3bn of Chinese loans as part of a wider trend that Kampala-based economist Ramathan Ggoobi calls its \"unrivalled willingness to avail unconditional capital to Africa\".\"This debt acquired from China comes with huge business for Chinese companies, particularly construction companies that have turned the whole of Africa into a construction site for rails, roads, electricity dams, stadia, commercial buildings and so on,\" the Makerere University Business School lecturer told the BBC.The Chinese loans come as many African countries are once again in danger of defaulting on their debts more than a decade after many had their outstanding borrowing written off.At least 40% of low-income countries in the region are either in debt distress or at high risk, the International Monetary Fund warned in April. Chad, Eritrea, Mozambique, Congo Republic, South Sudan and Zimbabwe were considered to be in debt distress at the end of 2017 while Zambia and Ethiopia were downgraded to \"high risk of debt distress\".\"In 2017 alone, the newly signed value of Chinese contracted projects in Africa registered $76.5bn,\" Standard Bank's China Economist Jeremy Stevens wrote in a note. \"However, despite a sizeable remaining infrastructure deficit on the continent, there is a concern that African countries' debt-service ability will soon dissolve,\" he says. The Chinese model has many high-profile defenders on the continent, including the head of the African Development Bank (ADB) Akinwumi Adesina, a former Nigerian agriculture minister.\"A lot of people get nervous about China but I am not. I think China is Africa's friend,\" he told the BBC. China is now the single largest bilateral financier of infrastructure in Africa, surpassing the ADB, the European Commission, the European Investment Bank, the International Finance Corporation, the World Bank and the Group of eight (G8) countries combined.  The money's impact is conspicuous all over Africa, from shiny new airports and roads as well as ports and high-rise buildings that are also creating much-needed jobs.In fact, a McKinsey and Company analysis found that the amount of loans Beijing had made to Africa had tripled since 2012, including an outsize $19bn to Angola alone in 2015 and 2016. It cited Angola and Zambia as unbalanced partners with China in Africa. \"In Angola's case, the government has supplied oil to China in exchange for Chinese financing and construction of major infrastructure projects - but market driven private investment by Chinese firms has been limited compared with other African countries,\" the firm said.  Africa has made significant new gains in trade, investment and financing arrangements with China, says Ghanaian investment analyst Michael Kottoh. \"There are several truly win-win deals African nations have closed without the typical onerous conditions associated historically with doing business with western countries,\" says Mr Kottoh, whose advisory firm Konfidants counsels international clients. \"But there is a sense in which China is obviously the bigger winner - simply because it has the upper leverage in most negotiations.\"McKinsey projects that revenues for Chinese firms in Africa could hit $440bn by 2025. Even Mr Adesina agreed that: \"The issue that I have seen is the asymmetry of power in the negotiations of the transactions, where you are actually giving your mining rights away just because you want to build a superhighway.  \"You are only dealing with one country, how are you sure that you are getting the best deal?\"China does not have a Foreign Corrupt Practices Act like the United States, or similar legislation in other Western countries that criminalise bribes paid overseas in exchange for contracts. Even though Nobel Prize-winning economist Joseph Stiglitz calls the Western criticism of China's work in Africa \"sour grapes,\" he admits that there are corruption concerns. \"Every project whether it comes from the west or China needs to be evaluated against the rate of returns,\" he told the BBC in Nairobi but added that it was up to the continent's governments to be more transparent.Mr Ggoobi also says there are greater concerns over the environmental effects of Chinese investments, \"particularly given the poor, weak, corrupt regulatory institutional infrastructure in Africa\".In 2015, the China Africa Research Initiative at the Johns Hopkins School of Advanced International Studies sounded alarm bells that African countries might be unable to repay Chinese loans \"due to fluctuating commodity prices and decreasing absorptive capacity\".\"We find that Chinese loans are not currently a major contributor to debt distress in Africa,\" they now say in a new briefing paper ahead of the 7th Forum on China Africa Cooperation Summit this week in Beijing. China has the lion's share of African debt but the countries are borrowing from many other sources internationally so it is not single-handedly to blame for indebtedness. When the summit last met, in Johannesburg, China promised $35bn in concessional foreign aid loans among other credit lines to Africa. What has not improved is what Standard Bank calls a \"significant trade deficit with China\" since 2014. It says only five African countries have a trade surplus with China. Mr Ggoobi wants China to help Africa build institutional capacity to attract and host viable investments using avenues like special economic zones and industrial parks to shore up the continent's export-focused manufacturing. So far, China has only paid lip service to such long-term support that would wean African countries off their dependency on the Asian tiger. Djibouti last month launched the first phase of the Chinese-built free trade zone billed as Africa's largest but it is seen as just another piece of the jigsaw puzzle as China revives old trade routes in its Belt and Road Initiative which targets 60 countries. Ugandans might enjoy soaring above the swampy Nambigirwa Bridge on their new expressway, but there are real fears that they could end up drowning in Chinese debt. ",

            "title": "Endometriosis: The pair who helped change Australia's conversation",
            "content": "Australia recently launched its first \"national action plan\" targeting endometriosis. It followed the advocacy of many - not least a mother and daughter who used viral success to fuel a wider conversation, writes Gary Nunn in Sydney.Earlier this year, Sylvia Freedman received a message from a woman she'd never met disclosing something she found \"bizarre, but lovely!\"The woman had decided to name her baby Sylvia, because without Sylvia's advocacy, she'd never have got pregnant.Syl suffers from endometriosis. Endometriosis (endo) currently has no known cause and no cure. It can cause severe pelvic pain and infertility. Back in 2013, Syl's university tutor, who also had endo, offered to mentor her through an honours thesis on coverage of endometriosis in the media.Their web search for media mentions of endometriosis returned zero mentions of the disease in any major Australian media outlets over 10 years. The tutor withdrew her offer, saying Syl couldn't do a literature review with nothing to review.It was a fresh blow after a decade of confusion, debilitating pain, missed classes, losing jobs and endless hours on the couch hugging a hot water bottle, wishing she lived inside a different body.  Today, Sylvia, 27, is having a good day. She's able to sit upright on a chair opposite me and her mum, Lesley at their home in Sydney. In the past, endo often left her unable to sit up, walk or even do up her jeans. Syl feels much better now partly thanks to effective excision surgery, daily self-management and Visanne - a drug designed to treat endo.This medication is now available in Australia because Lesley and Sylvia took on pharmaceutical giant Bayer - and won.Lesley discovered that Visanne was having success in treating endo-related pain overseas, but Bayer would not bring it to Australia and New Zealand. \"The marketing manager said I'd need to convince them there's a market for it here,\" she says.Lesley started emailing her friends, but Syl thought there had to be a quicker way. She shared her story on Change.org, asking people to sign their petition targeting Bayer. The signatures would prove the need.In total, they got 74,064 signers. Though the medication does not work for everyone, the pair were thrilled. Lesley wrote to supporters online: \"Together, we've changed the mind of one of the world's biggest pharmaceutical companies.\" From there they founded their own not-for-profit, EndoActive, which raises awareness, provides evidence-based information and advocates on behalf of the 700,000 women and girls with endo in Australia. They convened Australia's first patient-centred endometriosis conference in 2015. \"Women were in tears before they even walked through the doors, relieved they were finally being taken seriously,\" Lesley says. \"Many women are not believed or told painful periods are normal.\" This awareness, along with work by others, helped bring about Australia's first National Action Plan for Endometriosis, launched last month.\"[Endo] is a silent epidemic, hidden due to stigma, misunderstanding, and society's easy dismissal of the importance and severity of pain in women,\" says Dr Susan Evans, a gynaecologist who is chair of the Pelvic Pain Foundation of Australia. \"Syl and Lesley have presented the story of girls and women in pain in a way that Australians appreciate, understand, and relate to. They've built on the work by women, advocates and consumers over many years to dramatically raise the profile of the condition.\"It's estimated that one in 10 women have endo. It occurs when tissue similar to the womb lining grows outside it in other parts of the body (from reproductive organs up to the brain), in some cases strangling and gluing together other organs, causing excruciating pain. It takes, on average, seven to 12 years to get diagnosed. Symptoms vary but can be devastating: many experience crippling pelvic pain, 30% have fertility problems, and 66% experience pain during sex.Syl would often turn up to work then vomit violently straight away. She was constantly fatigued. Two surgeries took months to recover from. \"Endo symptoms are so weird and so random you feel like you're going insane,\" she says. \"I still get anxious that people think I'm faking it.\"The problem is, endo is an invisible illness. \"The other day I had conjunctivitis\" Syl says. \"Everyone was saying 'you poor thing'. I thought, this is nothing! If only endo was this obvious.\"Women have had to face such challenges in the diagnosis and treatment of endo, that Health Minister Greg Hunt made a national apology in December to recognise the pain and problems they've encountered in receiving adequate medical advice and treatment. \"Hearing that was so moving,\" Syl says.Mr Hunt recently made a A$4.7m (£2.7m; $3.4m) commitment to the National Action Plan for Endometriosis and Syl now sits on the steering committee. Their first meeting will have many action points but debunking myths is high on Syl's list.\"Like so many women, I was told by a doctor that getting pregnant would help my pain,\" she says. \"I was 21, in agony and without a partner. I asked my best friend, who's gay, if he'd consider having a baby with me. Mum considered recruiting her friend's son. I'd never even met him. That's how desperate we were. \"Now we know pregnancy isn't a cure. We need to re-educate doctors as well as patients.\"Dr Evans says: \"Throughout the world, endometriosis and pelvic pain are under-recognised, under-researched, under-managed and under-supported. There's vast unmet human need in this area and change has been slow.\"",
