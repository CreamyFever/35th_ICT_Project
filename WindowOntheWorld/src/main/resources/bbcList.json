            "title": "How significant is India's landmark privacy judgement?",
            "content": "In many ways, Thursday's Supreme Court ruling that Indians have a fundamental right to privacy is one of country's most significant judgements in the last two decades. By ruling that the right to privacy is \"an intrinsic part of Article 21 that protects life and liberty\", the verdict overturned two previous rulings by the top court which said privacy was not a fundamental right. Many believe the ruling has immediate implications for the government's vast biometric ID scheme, covering access to benefits, bank accounts and payment of taxes. Also, the verdict espouses a set of beliefs and lays down the groundwork for scrapping a controversial 2013 ruling by the top court, that upheld a law criminalising gay sex. (Last year, the court agreed to revisit the judgement.) It  provides a boost to petitioners for LGBT rights. It says you cannot compel people to incriminate themselves when accused of an offence, something common in India. \"The sheer sweep means the judgement will become a reference point in a lot of areas of law,\" leading lawyer Rebecca John told me. \"I think it will have far reaching implications on Indian life.\"At a time when many Indians worry that some of their essential private freedoms are under threat - the right to eat what you want, and the way you want to dress, for example -  the judges offer some stirring passages in what is a largely a cogent and well-researched 547-page verdict:The judgement is, in parts, a rousing philosophical articulation of the right to privacy and the importance of an independent, dignified life for the individual. The verdict is remarkable because, as scholar Pratap Bhanu Mehta told me, it \"asks us to look at a system of rights as an interconnected whole\" rather than dealing with them in isolation. What appears to be less clear are the implications the judgement will have on the use of state power in collecting personal information. For one, it recognises that there are compelling state interests in collecting such information. It talks about a \"careful and sensitive balance between individual interests and legitimate concerns of the state\" like national security, prevention and investigation of crime and ensuring social welfare benefits reach those they are intended for, a point seized upon by the ruling BJP government in its response to the judgement.  The verdict supports a \"careful balancing of the requirements of privacy coupled with other values which the protection of data sub-serves together with the legitimate concerns of the state\".These caveats raise a number of questions.How will be the biometric ID card-based litigations be adjudicated in the light of Thursday's verdict? (A smaller bench will now look into the validity of the Aadhaar scheme, the largest biometric identity scheme in the world.) Will the state agencies will be given carte blanche to make this data mandatory to access benefits? What about the information that has already been collected and shared across databases? How do you balance competing public and private interests when the government links the ID to tax returns to supposedly prevent fraud and evasion and private mobile networks using the ID to sign up consumers? Also, what about media intrusion into public lives? \"What India still needs is a detailed and transparent information architecture detailing which agency or vendor shares what information with whom, and a proper privacy architecture and how you can protect yourself if the state messes with your identity,\" says Dr Mehta, former president of India's Centre for Policy Research think-tank and now vice-chancellor of Ashoka University. \"And, to be fair, that's not something that the court can adjudicate upon.\"Many believe Thursday's judgement is a wake-up call for the government. They want it to stop treating privacy with a cavalier casualness and realise it is a matter of crucial importance. India's top court has finally given a legal basis for all privacy-related challenges.",

            "title": "India Supreme Court reopens case on decriminalising gay sex",
            "content": "India's Supreme Court has agreed to revisit a previous judgement that upheld a law criminalising gay sex. Three senior judges said the 2013 ruling would be re-examined by a larger bench of judges, in a move that has been welcomed by activists. The judges said that the issue was a \"matter of constitutional importance\". According to Section 377 of the Indian Penal Code (IPC), a 155-year-old colonial-era law, a same-sex relationship is an \"unnatural offence\".In deeply conservative India, homosexuality is a taboo and many people still regard same-sex relationships as illegitimate.There has been a very vocal campaign to decriminalise homosexuality in India. On Tuesday, the court heard a \"curative petition\" - meant to \"cure\" an earlier court order perceived as a \"miscarriage of justice\".The court said the five-judge bench would be headed by the chief justice of India. No date has been announced for the next hearing into the matter. Members of the LGBT community, standing outside the court, broke into cheers and impromptu celebrations when the decision was announced, the BBC's Soutik Biswas said.Activists say police and authorities often misuse the law to harass homosexuals. Under this law, a same-sex relationship is punishable by a 10-year jail term.In its 2009 ruling, the Delhi High Court had described Section 377 as discriminatory and said gay sex between consenting adults should not be treated as a crime.The ruling was widely and visibly welcomed by India's gay community, which said the judgement would help protect them from harassment and persecution.However, several political, social and religious groups petitioned the Supreme Court to have the law reinstated, and in 2013 the top court upheld the law, saying it was up to parliament to legislate on Section 377. However, an Indian MP's bid to introduce a private member's bill in the parliament to decriminalise gay sex failed. Shashi Tharoor who also started a petition on Change.org over the issue, which has more than 40,000 signatories, said \"it is time to bring the Indian Penal Code into the 21st Century\".",

            "title": "Why the Woodward effect damages Trump",
            "content": "The publication of Fear: Trump in the White House pits America's commander in chief against Washington's chronicler in chief. The credibility contest is key. I wonder how many journalists have arrived in Washington over the years dreaming of becoming the next Bob Woodward. Hoping that they'll be invited to descend into some subterranean car park, where a high-ranking contact, another \"Deep Throat, mutters cryptic, and not-so cryptic instructions: \"follow the money\". Perhaps they've imagined being played in a movie by a Robert Redford or his female equivalent. Perhaps they have fantasised about bringing down a president. Working alongside Carl Bernstein - who came to be played, of course, by Dustin Hoffman in All the President's Men - Bob Woodward set the journalistic bar that high. His shoe leather reporting following the break-in at the Democratic National Committee headquarters in the Watergate complex in June 1972 was a principal reason for the fall of Richard Nixon. Carl Bernstein went on to become a celebrity journalist: a black-tie regular on the New York cocktail circuit, a summer fixture in the Hamptons, an object of fascination for the Big Apple tabloid gossip columns. But one of the reasons why Bob Woodward has achieved such stature in the forty years since Nixon flashed that bizarre victory salute from the South Lawn of the White House as he exited the presidency is that he never sought to become Robert Redford, but remained avowedly Bob Woodward. Though his books are often sensational, he is the opposite of sensationalist. He's diligent, rigorous, fastidious about the facts, and studiously ethical. There's something almost monastic about his method. Indeed, a criticism of his books is that the prose can be flat and lifeless, a reflection of his steady state emotion. The topics of Woodward's presidential studies can also sometimes be dry. His book on Bill Clinton focussed not on the drama of Monica Lewinsky or impeachment but rather discussions on the budget deficit, welfare reform and healthcare. With Obama, it wasn't the romance of America's Black Camelot, but the handling of the wars in Afghanistan and Iraq, and the quest for fiscal rectitude. One of the reasons he's taken so seriously is that he covers the serious work of government.Nor has his focus solely been the West Wing. After All the President's Men and The Final Days, his Nixonian bestsellers, came The Brethren, which studied the Supreme Court. Veil, published in 1987, looked at the secret wars of the CIA. The Commanders focused on the Pentagon during the first Gulf War. Maestro, his biography of Alan Greenspan, probed the recondite world of The Federal Reserve.Though Woodward is a consummate Washington insider, there's also a sense of detachment about his work. He rarely troubles himself with the day-to-day. He doesn't become consumed by the controversy of the hour. His Twitter account registers just 93 tweets since he joined the social media platform in 2013. He tries assiduously to remain above the fray. And at a time when commentary has become so overblown, when the language of Washington debate has become so hysterical and extreme, this seventy-five year old has remained the straight man. The most vivid passages of his books usually come from the quotes of his high-level sources. That's certainly true of Fear. It's John Kelly the chief of staff, who describes the Trump White House as \"Crazytown\". It's James Mattis who apparently mocks the president as a 5th or 6th grader - a ten year old. Mattis has denied saying those things. Kelly says he didn't call the president an \"idiot\". But try winning a credibility contest against Bob Woodward, one of America's most trusted journalists. So detailed are his studies - and so well-sourced - that they've become part of the historical record. His trilogy of books on George W Bush - Bush at War, Plan of Attack and State of Denial - have not yet been bettered. The Commanders remains a classic.Long before the presidential libraries undertake their own oral history projects, chronicling the reflections, grudges and grievances of former administration officials, the key players have usually shared their thoughts with Bob Woodward. Christopher Hitchens once derided him as \"the stenographer of the rich and the powerful\" but it's his access that explains why the Woodward effect is so impactful; why the publication of his books become news events in their own right.The fact that newsrooms in Washington are populated by so many would-be Woodwards has a downside. The desire to topple presidents can lead to journalistic over-reach. B- and c-grade scandals are elevated and exaggerated. Whitewater during the Clinton years is a prime example of that. The \"gate\" suffix has become a dreary cliché, overused and under-thought. Since Watergate, a lot of political coverage has been predicated on the strong suspicion that presidents have surely committed illegal acts or are abusing their power. It's become a recurring line of attack in successive presidencies, and Washington has become more toxic and mistrustful as a result. But Woodward himself has not gone down that path. When it comes to bringing down a president, he's been there, done that and even been portrayed in the movie. This history-making journalist has become the Beltway's resident journalist/historian. Bob Woodward has become an institution. He's Washington's chronicler in chief.",

            "content": "India's Supreme Court is due to deliver a landmark verdict on Thursday, when it will decide if gay sex should remain a criminal offence in the country.Thursday's ruling re-examines a 2013 judgement that upheld a colonial-era law, known as section 377, under which gay sex is categorised as an \"unnatural offence\".There has been a very vocal campaign to decriminalise homosexuality in India.Many activists are expecting the court to overrule its previous judgement. They believe the court strongly indicated its stance on the matter, in a landmark judgement it made on the right to privacy in August last year. It said then that \"discrimination against an individual on the basis of sexual orientation is deeply offensive to the dignity and self-worth of the individual\". In 2016, when the court agreed to hear the section 377 petition once more, three senior judges said they felt the issue was a \"matter of constitutional importance\".Thursday's verdict will be delivered by a five-judge bench headed by India's outgoing chief justice Dipak Mishra. It's a 157-year-old colonial-era law which criminalises certain sexual acts as \"unnatural offences\" which are punishable by a 10-year jail term.The law punishes, in its own words, \"carnal inter­course against the order of nature with any man, woman or animal\". While the statute criminalises all anal and oral sex, it has had a much bigger implication for same-sex relationships. Activists have frequently said that the law has been used to harass members of the country's gay and transgender communities.Equal rights campaigners have also argued that the very existence of such a law is proof of discrimination based on sexual orientation.

            "title": "Kosovo-Serbia talks: Why land swap could bridge divide",
            "content": "A historic moment or a proposal that would mean war? When it comes to Kosovo's putative territory swap with Serbia, it depends who you ask.  Speculation abounds that the two parties could make the concept official as early as Friday, when their presidents meet for scheduled talks in Brussels. The idea seems simple. The Presevo Valley in southern Serbia, where the population is mostly ethnic Albanian, would join Kosovo. In return, Serbia would re-establish full control over the majority ethnic-Serb area of Kosovo to the north of the River Ibar, which runs through the heart of Mitrovica.Proponents say a territory swap would, potentially, end the stalemate which has persisted for 10 years, since Kosovo unilaterally declared its independence from Serbia. \"Border change may seem distasteful, but many regard it as a practical solution,\" says James Ker-Lindsay, a Balkans specialist at the London School of Economics. \"If there were a consensual agreement between the two sides, it would open the way for a full normalisation of relations between Belgrade and Pristina and allow Kosovo finally to become a member of the United Nations.\" But before the idea has even been fully articulated, it is already taking flak. The Western Balkans went through a convulsion of border changes in the 1990s.More than 100,000 people died and millions were displaced in ethnically driven conflicts.  Paddy Ashdown oversaw the aftermath in Bosnia, as the international High Representative. He has co-authored an appeal to the European Union's foreign policy chief, Federica Mogherini, to stamp out any talk of a territory swap.  \"Moving borders like this will not solve divisions, it will deepen them,\" said the letter, warning that nationalist politicians might use a territory swap to agitate for the break-up of Bosnia.  \"Sustainable peace can only come when we learn to live in multi-ethnic communities, rather than re-drawing borders to create mono-ethnic ones. [There is] no policy more likely to lead us back to division and conflict in the Balkans than the one which some are apparently now supporting.\" More stories from Kosovo and SerbiaMs Mogherini has a key role to play. She chairs the normalisation talks in Brussels between Serbia's President Aleksandar Vucic, and his opposite number from Kosovo, Hashim Thaci. Without explicitly mentioning a territory swap, she has been urging the two sides to settle their differences.  \"The time has come to put an end to that conflict,\" she said on Monday.  \"I am confident that presidents Vucic and Thaci will manage to achieve a binding legal agreement for the normalisation of relations and this agreement will comply with international law and it will help for the stability of the entire region.\" Ms Mogherini's predecessor, Cathy Ashton, initiated the normalisation talks. She told the BBC that both presidents were \"trying to get to a conclusion\" but that international approval would be the key to any deal.  \"The key to the solution will be how Brussels responds. They will look to Berlin and talk to Paris and others. In the end, it's about EU membership for both.\" Germany has been vocal in its opposition to border changes, but it is short of backup from other EU member states, with the UK otherwise engaged. Small wonder that the EU commissioner for enlargement, Johannes Hahn, has been talking about a \"historic moment\" for Serbia and Kosovo.Local concerns are another matter. Nationalists in both Serbia and Kosovo will be reluctant to make a deal that gives the other side succour.  The former Kosovo Liberation Army commander and current prime minister, Ramush Haradinaj, has been vehemently opposed, saying that changing borders would lead to war. Meanwhile ethnic Serbs living south of the Ibar are worried they will be abandoned if the north reverts to Serbia.A European diplomat told the BBC that the territory swap was \"serious from the Serb side\" but that a lack of unity in Pristina could be a problem.  \"Thaci has gone solo on this so far - he hasn't been making the arguments to get people on board. It could be a compelling proposition, but he needs to sell it.\"  The United States has indicated that it would not stand in the way of any bilateral deal. The stance of Serbia's ally, Russia, is harder to gauge; President Vladimir Putin is due to visit Belgrade next month. There are significant prizes on offer for both sides, if they can agree a deal.Kosovo may finally be recognised by the 80-odd countries which have refused to acknowledge its legitimacy. And Serbia would fulfil a key condition for its membership of the EU.  With Macedonia and Greece settling their long-standing dispute, there is fresh momentum to solve another Balkan conundrum. For Kosovo and Serbia, the door is open.",

            "title": "Scallop row: French fishermen wary of UK deal",
            "content": "A deal has been reached to bring an end to the skirmishes between French and British fishermen in the Channel, but boat captains on the Normandy coast have vowed to fight on if any British boats come near their fishing grounds before October.The agreement is yet to be signed and among those with most at stake are the two captains of La Rose Des Vents and Le Sachal'eo, whose dramatic collision with a Scottish trawler last week was caught on video.Anthony Quesnel, captain of La Rose Des Vents, returned to Ouistreham's empty dock on Wednesday after a night at sea and almost a tonne of mackerel, sole and plaice. But, in keeping with French rules, there were no scallops until the end of the breeding season at the start of October.Like many fishermen here, he is adamant that British boats should abide by those same French rules when it comes to fishing for scallops - even though the UK government has in the past imposed no similar restrictions on its vessels.Their refusal to do so justified the attack last week, he argues. \"Whatever happens,\" he told me, \"I don't think the British will come back, because if they do another confrontation is inevitable. We'll defend our livelihood. I can't just stand by and watch.\"For the past few years, a carefully constructed truce has kept the peace over this watery battlefield. The British agreed to ban their larger fishing vessels from the area until October, in return for extra fishing rights, and on the understanding that smaller British boats could fish there all year round.But the number of smaller boats coming across the Channel has been growing and this year the French asked that all British boats stay away from the scallop fishing grounds until the catch could be shared.Smaller British fishermen are already feeling hard done by because the vast majority of their EU fishing quotas go to larger British industrial fishing fleets, and many struggle to make a profit. But scallops are not restricted by standard EU quotas. Larger vessels have limits on the number of days they can fish for them but smaller boats do not - an important symbolic advantage.Under the deal sketched out in London on Wednesday, the limits on bigger boats will remain. But the smaller British boats under 15m (50ft) will be subjected to the same rules and be given compensation for losses. The terms still have to be finalised in Paris on Friday. But the two governments said that under a voluntary agreement all UK vessels would \"respect the French closure period in the Baie de Seine\".Mr Quesnel said the conflict was the fault of the leaders, not the fishermen from either side. The idea behind the French rule, he said, was \"to let the scallops reproduce, not to fish it all out in three weeks and leave nothing behind. I believe the British boats all came this year to catch as much scallop as possible, because they know they won't have access to these after waters after [Brexit]\".A few kilometres away, in a tiny shed at Dives-sur-Mer, fish and mussels are being emptied straight from the boats on to a handful of well-scrubbed counters.One of the fishermen here, Frank Tousch, remembers the clashes last week as \"frightening\". His tiny boat, Le Sachal'eo, was crushed between La Rose Des Vents and a 30m Scottish vessel, after he joined the demonstration at sea. He shows us the cracks still running along the top of the wooden hull which he says will take him two weeks to repair.\"It pushed me from behind, up against La Rose Des Vents. Then pulled alongside to crush me,\" he said. \"I was very scared; it was such a big boat. We were lucky that our hull was plastic so it bounced back into shape. Had it been all made of wood, it would have been crushed.\"Frank agrees that the only way to solve the stand-off is for all British boats to observe the same restrictions as French fishermen.The owner of La Rose Des Vents, Fabrice Huout, joins us at the market. Despite the attack on British vessels, he says, the anger is not personal.  \"They're fishermen like us,\" he said. I asked him whether he'd do the same in British waters if the situation were reversed. His response: \"Why not, if we were allowed to?\" Back at Ouistreham, Anthony Quesnel is preparing to head to sea again, keeping an eye out for British fishing boats along the way.Last week's attack was hastily organised, he told me, and many of the 300 local fishermen didn't get enough notice to join in.  Next time, he says, they will.",

            "content": "US President Donald Trump's Supreme Court nominee has declined to say whether he thinks sitting presidents can be made to comply with a legal subpoena.The court order forces a witness to appear to give testimony. In a second day of Senate hearings, Brett Kavanaugh said no-one was above the law but he would not be drawn on what he called a hypothetical question. He also declined to say if he thought presidents could pardon themselves.The BBC's Gary O'Donoghue, in Washington, says the investigation into alleged collusion between the Trump campaign and Russia in the 2016 election has raised important constitutional questions about the extent to which an incumbent president can be forced to co-operate. Democrats are keen to push Mr Kavanaugh on the issue, he adds.Mr Kavanaugh, 53, who faces a four-day confirmation hearing before the Senate Judiciary Committee, was also pressed on his approach to gun rights and the law around abortion.He said he understood the importance of the precedent in the landmark 1973 case, Roe v Wade, which legalised abortion nationwide, pointing out it had been reaffirmed by the Supreme Court several times.If confirmed, the conservative appeals court judge would be expected to tilt the court's balance to the right. Chuck Grassley, the Republican chairman of the Judiciary Committee, asked Mr Kavanaugh whether he would have any trouble ruling against the president who nominated him, to which he responded: \"No-one is above the law in our constitutional system.\"\"I think the first quality of a good judge in our constitutional system is independence,\" he added.Senior Democrat Dianne Feinstein asked if he thought a sitting president could be \"required to respond to a subpoena\".\"I can't give you an answer on that hypothetical question,\" Mr Kavanaugh said.He gave a similar answer to Democratic Senator Patrick Leahy who asked whether a president could issue a pardon to himself or to someone else in exchange for promising not to testify against the president.In a tweet in June, President Trump said he had \"the absolute right to PARDON myself\".On abortion, Mr Kavanaugh said he understood people's strong feelings and he described Roe v Wade as \"an important precedent of the Supreme Court that has been reaffirmed many times\".Supporters of abortion rights fear Mr Kavanaugh could provide the decisive fifth vote on the nine-seat court to overturn the 1973 ruling.On the issue of gun rights, Senator Feinstein pressed Mr Kavanaugh on his previous opposition to a ban on semi-automatic rifles. Such weapons have been used in a string of deadly high school shootings.\"Of course the violence in the schools is something we all detest and want to do something about,\" Mr Kavanaugh said, but added that handguns and other semi-automatic weapons were also used for hunting and self-defence.For a second day, protesters interrupted proceedings before being removed by security personnel.On Tuesday, there were angry scenes minutes after Mr Kavanaugh entered the committee rooms. The hearing was disrupted by angry shouts from members of the public and lawmakers alike.Texas Republican John Cornyn said it was \"the first confirmation hearing for a Supreme Court justice I've seen basically according to mob rule\".The US Capitol Police said 61 people were removed from the committee room on Tuesday and arrested for disorderly conduct.Republicans have a slim majority in the 100-seat upper house. They can confirm Mr Kavanaugh if they stay united. So far, there are no signs of Republican defections. Not all Democrats have said they will oppose Mr Kavanaugh, and several may even support his nomination. The Senate is likely to vote on confirmation by the end of the month. The court begins its next term in October.He studied law at Yale and is a resident of the wealthy Washington suburb of Chevy Chase. He worked under special counsel Kenneth Starr in his investigation into President Bill Clinton's relationship with intern Monica Lewinsky in the 1990s. Under George W Bush, he served as deputy White House counsel and, from 2003-06, as Mr Bush's staff secretary. A Catholic, he has been a US Court of Appeals judge in Washington for the past 11 years.

            "content": "A major international airport in western Japan has been closed, with thousands of people evacuated, in the wake of deadly Typhoon Jebi.Kansai airport, a major transport hub serving Osaka, Kobe and Kyoto, was cut off when an ocean tanker hit and damaged its bridge to the mainland. Jebi, Japan's most powerful storm in 25 years, has killed at least 10 people.In a separate incident, a 6.6 magnitude earthquake caused a landslide on Japan's northern island of Hokkaido.A number of houses in the town of Atsumi were engulfed and several people were said to be trapped. There were no reports of fatalities.The quake came as Typhoon Jebi left a trail of damage to infrastructure, ripping off roofs, overturning vehicles and cutting power.The tanker was unmoored by the strong winds of Typhoon Jebi and drifted into the bridge.Kansai International Airport is built on a man-made island and is linked to the mainland by the bridge.About 3,000 passengers were stranded overnight, some for more than 18 hours in terminals without power, before ferries and speedboats were deployed to evacuate them on Wednesday.One passenger told broadcaster NHK: \"We had a blackout so there was no air conditioning. It was hot.\"Some people were able to leave on buses, using an unaffected part of the damaged bridge.Runways were also severely hit by surging water, with some aircraft flooded up to their engines.All flights have been cancelled and there is no confirmation of when the airport will reopen. The Kansai airport website could only say that the runways and bridge would reopen on \"6 September or later\". Some reports said it could take a week.In 2016, Kansai handled some 25 million passengers, making it the third busiest in Japan.It recorded winds of up to 216km/h (135mph) and made landfall at about noon local time on Tuesday (03:00 GMT).It moved quickly northwards over the mainland in the west of the country.In addition to the deaths, some 300 people were injured, officials said.Some 400,000 households are said to be still without power.The winds brought down part of the ceiling in the main railway station in the tourist hub of Kyoto.Images showed containers in ports thrown about like toy bricks and vehicles scattered across roads.Dozens of cars were engulfed in fire at a depot in Nishinomiya as water short-circuited electrics.Some 1.2 million people had been advised to leave evacuated areas as the storm approached and local media say some 16,000 took to designated shelters overnight.Prime Minister Shinzo Abe tweeted: \"We continue to make utmost efforts to respond to disaster damage and restore infrastructure.\"The Universal Studios Japan theme park in Osaka was closed again on Wednesday but should reopen on Thursday.Footage on social media showed the 100m (328ft) tall ferris wheel in Osaka spinning rapidly in the storm despite being switched off.",

            "title": "Jerusalem embassy: Why Trump's move was not about peace",
            "content": "\"Our greatest hope is for peace.\" Those were the words of Donald Trump in a recorded message at the Jerusalem ceremony. But the opening line in White House talking points cut straight to the top priority: \"President Donald J Trump keeps his promise.\" Mr Trump decided to move the US embassy from Tel Aviv to Jerusalem because he likes to keep campaign promises made to his base. He also likes to make big bold historic moves, especially if that means delivering where his predecessors did not. So far so good on the principles of Trumpian foreign policy. In this case, his base also lobbied hard for the move. That included right-wing American Jews whose message was amplified by the conservative orthodox Jews dominating Mr Trump's inner circle. It also included evangelicals whose voice was amplified by the devout Christian in the White House, Vice-President Mike Pence. \"God decided Jerusalem was the capital of Israel more than 3,000 years ago during the time of King David,\" I was told by Dallas evangelical pastor Robert Jeffress, who cited Biblical history. He and another leading voice in the pro-Israel part of the Christian world delivered prayers at the opening ceremony. \"The United States remains fully committed to facilitating a lasting peace agreement,\" Mr Trump also said in his recorded message. He has declared an interest in solving the \"toughest deal of all\" and, despite the outrage over Jerusalem, the White House is still intent on rolling out a detailed initiative of a settlement it thinks is achievable. Its authors - Mr Trump's son-in-law Jared Kushner and his lawyer Jason Greenblatt - concluded that shaking up the status quo could help their efforts by giving the Palestinians a dose of reality, says former Mid-East negotiator Aaron David Miller. They also thought the Palestinians would eventually rally and resume contact after their initial shock and anger, according to the New York Times. So far they have not. And the Palestinian deaths in Gaza make that prospect even less likely.The administration argues it is simply recognising the obvious in accepting Jerusalem as Israel's capital and that the city's final boundaries can still be determined in negotiations. But confusingly, Mr Trump has also said he has taken the issue \"off the table\". And he has failed to say anything about Palestinian claims to East Jerusalem. So whatever the intent, he appears to have sided with Israel on one of the most volatile issues in the peace process and prejudiced the final outcome of any talks.The Trump administration has also sided with Israel in its response to the deadly violence on the Gaza border. The White House accused Gaza's Hamas leaders of \"intentionally and cynically\" provoking Israel in an attempt at \"gruesome propaganda\" but, unlike European countries, it did not call on the army to exercise restraint. Hamas has been directing the weeks-long protest campaign by Palestinians frustrated with Israel's economic blockade of Gaza. Analysts said it was a chance for the militant Islamist movement to shift the blame for its own poor performance in government. The question now is whether the hundreds of casualties will trigger an uprising, or intifada, that spreads to the West Bank. The Jerusalem decision itself did not do so and there are many reasons why the Gaza violence may not. That includes divisions in the Palestinian leadership and the high cost for Palestinians of a return to sustained conflict. But it is a volatile situation fuelled by a sense of Palestinian hopelessness that could lead to further escalation. What seems more likely to me at the moment is a slower unravelling of the peace process framework which for the past 25 years has led to neither peace nor all-out war. Despite spasms of conflict, it has maintained certain fundamentals. The Israelis have not annexed the West Bank. The Palestinian Authority continues security co-operation, in effect helping Israel police its own people. The framework is held up by an American mediator that is seen by many as somewhat credible, if not neutral. Every previous US administration has been pro-Israel but made some effort to understand and respond to the Palestinian narrative, says Mr Miller.This one is so \"deeply ensconced\" in the Israeli narrative it has crossed a red line, he says. If so, it will be difficult for it to keep propping up the framework, with unpredictable results. It is true that key Arab countries seem more willing to sanction a settlement less favourable to the Palestinians than before because they want Israel as an ally against Iran. But Mr Trump's decision on Jerusalem, and Israel's heavy-handed approach in Gaza, reduces their room for manoeuvre.",

            "title": "Israeli threat to Bedouin villages",
            "content": "Ten-year-old Manar is a good student. Like many girls of her age she loves going to school, the boys perhaps less so. But Manar's school, built from old tyres held together with mud and serving the desert community of Khan al-Ahmar some 10km (6 miles) east of Jerusalem, is precarious in more ways than one.All of the students here are Bedouin - Arab nomads who fled from their traditional homelands in the Negev desert to this dusty valley in the West Bank after Israel's war of independence in 1948.Now Israel, which has occupied the area since 1967, wants them to move again - and to demolish their school.Eid Abu Hamis is the nominal head of the community. An intelligent man who speaks both Arabic and Hebrew fluently, Eid paid to put himself through university. But, says the qualified accountant, it is increasingly difficult for Bedouin to succeed in Israeli society because of ever-tighter restrictions on their movements.Like the rest of his community, Mr Abu Hamis lives in what can only be described as sparse, basic conditions.Traditional tents may have given way to structures made from wood and plastic, but without running water, mains electricity or sewage the Bedouin way of life is not to everyone's taste or comfort. There are, of course, lots of grazing animals in pens and wandering the dusty slopes around the encampment. But Mr Abu Hamis says they only now rear about one tenth of the goats and camels they used to because they no longer have unrestricted access to their traditional grazing lands.They are also no longer able to sell their produce in the main markets - Jerusalem's Old City in particular.With his fair share of worries, one thing preoccupies the village headman more than anything else - the demolition order hanging over the school.\"The school has transformed this community,\" Mr Abu Hamis tells me as we sit under the ample shade of a fig tree in an otherwise barren landscape. \"More than half the pupils at the school are girls. That was almost unheard of for Bedouin, but if the school is closed [as the Israeli military order demands] the girls will drop out of education.\"Sitting pretty on the hilltops above the valley, overlooking the school, are several well-maintained and neat Jewish settlements. Settlements in the occupied territories are illegal under international law, though Israel disputes this. Israel says this is (Israeli) state land and it has plans to develop the settlements. The Bedouin, they say, have no legal right to be here, so they must move on.Aryeh Eldad is a member of the Israeli Parliament, the Knesset, and is a vocal proponent of Israel's right to own and populate all of historic Palestine, including the areas where the Bedouin have lived and reared their animals for hundreds of years. Looking out over the Jordan Valley, from the vantage point of his veranda in Kfar Adumim, Mr Eldad acknowledges that Israel has some sort of responsibility for the thousands of Bedouin living on territory under its control, but says they cannot stay where they are.\"We know what they're up to,\" says the man who was once one of Israel's most celebrated surgeons, but who now dedicates much of his time to exercising the rights of Israeli settlers over Judea and Samaria - Israel's term for the West Bank. \"The school is there for purely political reasons so they [the Bedouin] can have a presence here. We know this is true because we settlers used to use the same tactics.\"A spokesman for the Co-ordinator of Government Activities in the Territories Unit (Cogat), an arm of the Israeli military responsible for implementing government policy in the West Bank, told the BBC: \"The school was built illegally and they had no permits for construction. So we issued stop orders and then demolition orders.\"The state is still waiting to find an appropriate place for relocation, but it will be demolished eventually.\" With movement and access to land increasingly restricted, the Bedouin say their way of life is under threat. In what has become a struggle for basic civil rights, Israel plans to relocate as many as 30,000 Bedouin from several different communities.Supporters of the Bedouin campaign to avoid relocation say that an even clearer example of what they call discrimination can be found inside the boundaries of Israel \"proper\".Umm al-Hiran lies in a wadi, or small valley, not far from the large town of Beersheba at the top end of the Negev desert. Some 100 Bedouin families live here. They are full Israeli citizens and were moved here in the 1950s by the Israeli government from their ancestral lands. Now the authorities want to evict them, destroy their homes and build a new community here, but one for religious Jews.Using a legal argument that has been upheld in the courts, Israel says this village, and many others, are unrecognised and therefore illegal, but campaigners argue the forced relocation of these communities would contravene international law.   \"You can call it apartheid, you can call it racism,\" says Suhad Bishara, a human rights lawyer who is fighting the plan to evict the residents of Uma al Hiran in the courts. \"The state wouldn't dare to say to anyone in Tel Aviv that we want to remove you put someone else in your place. It's like the Wild West, human rights are suspended and the rule of law is suspended.\"Back in the dusty yard of her home just below the school built from tyres and mud in Khan al Amar, Manar is concentrating hard on her homework. She tells me she has a dream, to one day become a teacher. Although the Israeli High Court has rejected a demand from the Jewish settlers that the Bedouin village and the school be destroyed immediately, a military demolition order still hangs over the school. Manar's father admits, if the village school is demolished, his daughter's dream might never be realised.",

            "content": "Japan has announced for the first time that a worker at the stricken Fukushima nuclear power plant died after suffering radiation exposure.The man, who was in his 50s, died from lung cancer that was diagnosed in 2016.Japan's government had previously agreed that radiation caused illness in four workers but this is the first acknowledged death.The Fukushima reactor suffered meltdowns after a 9.0 magnitude earthquake and a tsunami in March 2011.Cooling systems were wrecked at the plant on Japan's north-east coast and radioactive material leaked out. The employee who died had worked at atomic power stations since 1980 and was in charge of measuring radiation at the Fukushima No 1 plant shortly after its meltdown. He worked there at least twice after it was damaged, and had worn a face mask and protective suit, Japan's Ministry of Health, Labour and Welfare said. After hearing opinions from a panel of radiologists and other experts, the ministry ruled that the man's family should be paid compensation.The Fukushima meltdown was the world's worst nuclear accident since Chernobyl in 1986. Around 18,500 people died or disappeared in the quake and tsunami, and more than 160,000 were forced from their homes.Though no-one died directly in the nuclear meltdown, plant operator Tokyo Electric Power Company (Tepco) is facing several compensation claims.More than 40 patients had to be evacuated from a hospital in the area and later died, while other deaths have been linked to the trauma suffered by those who lost their homes and loved ones. In June last year, three former Tepco executives went on trial charged with professional negligence linked to the hospital evacuation.",

            "content": "More than $400,000 (£307,000) that was raised for a homeless man with the help of two strangers is gone, his lawyers have told the BBC.The story of Johnny Bobbitt led to over 14,000 people to contribute to a GoFundMe campaign. He sued the couple who started it for mismanagement.A judge ordered the couple to testify about what happened to the money after the court heard the funds were gone. GoFundMe says they have established a $20,000 fund for Mr Bobbitt's care.Jacqueline Promislo, a lawyer representing the homeless US veteran in his case against Mark D'Amico and Kate McClure, confirmed in an email to the BBC that they were told \"the money is all gone\" in a conference call on Tuesday.She added that lawyers will now begin \"expedited discovery\" to see if any of the funds can be recovered.\"It completely shocked me when I heard,\" Chris Fallon, another lawyer for Mr Bobbitt, told the Philadelphia Inquirer on Tuesday after he heard the money had been spent. During a hearing in New Jersey on Wednesday, Superior Court Judge Paula Dow ordered the couple to appear in court to testify about what happened to the money. Mr D'Amico and Ms McClure's lawyer, Ernest Badway, reportedly told the court about $200,000 went to Mr Bobbitt but later said he was \"misadvised\" by the couple. He then said there was no money left. Mr Badway told the BBC on Wednesday that he had no comment.Mr Bobbitt's original Good Samaritan deed went viral last year when he gave his last $20 to Ms McClure after her car ran out of petrol.The couple responded by starting an online appeal which drew global attention, but their relationship with Mr Bobbitt eventually soured as they accused him of using the money to feed a drug habit.Mr Bobbitt, originally from North Carolina, filed a lawsuit for fraud and conspiracy last week, saying that the New Jersey couple had used the GoFundMe donations as their own \"piggy bank\".GoFundMe spokesman Bobby Withorne told the Inquirer that the company had depositing $20,000 into Mr Bobbitt's escrow account as the legal case proceeds.\"We are working with law enforcement officials to ensure Johnny receives all of the funds raised on his behalf,\" Mr Withorne said. \"While we assist law enforcement with their ongoing investigation, GoFundMe is also working with Johnny's legal team to ensure he's receiving support while the remaining funds are being recovered.\"If GoFundMe determines that funds were misused, donors will be reimbursed up to $1,000, according to company policy.Last week, Mr D'Amico told NBC that about $150,000 remained. He said only a week earlier that $200,000 of Mr Bobbitt's money had not yet been spent. Mr Bobbitt's lawyers told the BBC last week that he estimates that the couple spent about $75,000 of the money to buy him a trailer, a pickup truck and clothing.The homeless veteran is reportedly back on the streets, where he and his brother are panhandling for money to buy food and drugs.\"Johnny is homeless,\" said Ms Promislo, \"which is not a safe environment for anyone.\" ",

            "content": "The lion was missing his courage, the tin man his heart and the scarecrow his brain. And in this alternate version of The Wizard of Oz, Dorothy was missing her ruby-red slippers.That was until this week, when it was announced that a pair of the shoes worn by Judy Garland in the 1939 film had been recovered, 13 years after they were stolen.It puts an end to a particularly intriguing disappearance - but here are five others that are still to be resolved.It was 31 December 1999 and fireworks were going off around Oxford as the new millennium was about to begin. Those who weren't celebrating were cowering in their bunkers in fear at what the Millennium Bug would bring.It was at this exact moment that someone entered the city's Ashmolean Museum, after sneaking in through a building site for a new library next door.The man - for it is believed to be a man - then let off a smoke canister to hide himself from cameras, before lifting Cézanne's Auvers-sur-Oise, a painting produced between 1879 and 1882 and worth at least £3m (now $3.8m).Police think it was stolen to order, and the theft remains on the FBI's list of Top Ten Art Crimes.This particular sword, or katana, was produced in 14th-Century Japan by renowned swordmaker Masamune and was named a national treasure in 1939.It was said to be able to split a helmet in two and was worn by the shoguns, or rulers, of Japan's military government for centuries.There's just one problem: no-one knows where it is now.It is not clear what happened to the sword, or 14 others from the same collection, but it may have been handed to American soldiers at the end of World War Two when Japan surrendered its weapons.A search for a soldier who may have taken it - identified as Coldy Bimore, but possibly misinterpreted as Cole D B Moore - has proven fruitless.Austrian concert violinist Erica Morini was gifted a Stradivarius violin, dating to 1727, by her father in the 1930s.In October 1995, when she was aged 91 and living in New York City, Morini was admitted to hospital. While she was there, the violin - believed to be worth $3.5m (now £2.7m) - was stolen from a cupboard in her locked apartment.Morini died a few days later, unaware of the theft, and the violin has never been recovered. Her case is not unique: there have been a number of thefts of Stradivarius violins in the US in recent years.On 26 November 1983, an armed gang raided the Brinks Mat warehouse near London's Heathrow Airport and stole close to three tonnes of gold bullion then worth about £26m.The Brinks Mat robbery was said to be the biggest in British history - 6,800 bars of gold in 76 boxes. And two boxes of diamonds.A number of people were jailed for their part in the robbery and for laundering the proceeds, but it is not known what happened to most of the gold. A small amount is known to have been melted in the city of Bath before being resold.In truth, the stolen gold is unlikely to be recovered, as it is all thought to have been melted and sold over the past 35 years.Security camera footage showed the thief, later nicknamed Spiderman, clambering in to Paris' Museum of Modern Art in May 2010, before taking his time to walk around.He went on to commit what one city official called \"a serious crime to the heritage of humanity\", stealing five paintings by Picasso, Matisse and other great artists. It was the biggest art heist in 20 years.The thief, Vjeran Tomic, was jailed last year, but he told police he had panicked and hidden the paintings in a bin, and had assumed they were then destroyed.In their report, investigators said they believed the paintings had been transferred abroad, but they added there was no firm proof of this.",

            "title": "Kabul bomb: The hell of losing loved ones in Afghanistan",
            "content": "BBC driver Mohammed Nazir was among scores of victims of Wednesday's bombing in Kabul's secure central zone. As Afghanistan  mourns those killed, the editor of the BBC's Afghan service Waheed Massoud, remembers a friend and colleague caught up in an all too familiar scenario. I woke to a phone call telling me that \"a BBC minibus\" had been caught up in the Kabul truck bomb attack. But we did not know for sure how bad it was, and how many of our colleagues were hurt. As things stand at least 90 were killed, but this toll will undoubtedly rise with hundreds injured. The immediate feeling was so familiar: a racing heart beat and a thousand simultaneous thoughts going through my head. My heart felt heavier. I felt it was sinking down to my feet. I desperately made phone calls any way I could - through Viber, WhatsApp, Facebook, and my mobile -  but to no avail. The whole network was down, another indication that something horrendous had happened. I was torn between hope and fear. Fearing the loss of another dear one and hoping that all would be fine. It is devastating when fear wins over hope; I soon found out that one dear colleague, Mohammed Nazir, our driver, had been killed and four other colleagues wounded.The truck bomb exploded close to Kabul's \"Green Zone\", the most secure place in the heart of the city protected by guards, blast walls and security boom gates. It killed and wounded dozens of people. I can imagine what Nazir's family, his wife and children, were going through as they were waiting for news from BBC colleagues who were searching hospitals and morgues to find him. As they prayed for good news, they too were battling fears and hopes. And they are not the only ones. The friends and family of the hundreds of victims of today's attack, like those of Mohammed Nazir, will have had the same experience.Mohammed Nazir was young. He was the father of three children and the only breadwinner in his family. He had a gentle smile and a warm personality. I knew Nazir for years and I worked with him most days of the week. BBC journalists, support staff and visitors remember him as an honest and reliable person. Most colleagues deploying from Kabul to dangerous provinces would prefer to go with Nazir. The irony is he survived decades of war, conflict and hostile environments but was killed by a bomb in the most secure diplomatic enclave in the heart of Kabul. Many BBC colleagues find it hard to believe that the smiling face that drove them to work this morning will be buried by the end of the same day. The thought that he is no longer with us is hanging over everyone. We think of his children, his wife and extended family and how they will survive without him in a country that does not have a welfare system.At least Nazir's family will receive financial support from the BBC. But what will happen to those of the others killed and wounded?The attack today not only took lives, and caused injury. It also in an instant changed the future for hundreds of families. Soon, the carnage of today will linger only as another casualty figure from yet another attack. Life will carry on. But what happened here in Kabul is simply a reflection of what Afghanistan has been experiencing over the past 38 years in various different forms and guises. The early post-2001 years were a brief period of hope when many believed the country would finally be able to breathe a sigh of relief from constant chaos. But it did not last long. Today, Afghanistan is as much a battleground for proxy wars and regional arm wrestling as it was decades ago, with ordinary Afghans feeling like victims of an unchosen fate.Although Nato military boots on the ground are present to provide training and support to the Afghan security forces and the government, the situation has not improved. The insurgents enjoy similar covert support today from regional players.As Wednesday's devastating events proved, security, even in the most protected areas, is fragile.Vulnerabilities in the security forces, or the sophistication of the insurgent groups, or both, could be to blame .But for the public the situation represents one continuous, and lifelong, nightmare.",

Goop also will be banned from selling medical devices that are falsely advertised or unapproved. The company agreed to pay $145,000 in civil penalties, and is also offering a refund for customers who purchased the eggs or the flower essence under false claims.

            "content": "Paraguay's new government has announced that it will move its embassy in Israel back to Tel Aviv - just three months after shifting it to Jerusalem. President Mario Abdo Benítez, who was sworn in last month, said he wanted to help achieve \"a just and durable peace\" in the Middle East.In response, Israel said it would close the Israeli embassy in Paraguay.However, the Palestinian Authority said it would \"immediately\" open an embassy in the South American country.Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu said Paraguay's move had cast a shadow on the countries' relations.Paraguay's previous leader, Horacio Cartes, decided to move the embassy in Israel in May, shortly after US President Donald Trump did the same. Mr Abdo Benítez was president-elect at the time, and made clear that he did not agree with the decision.Mr Trump had unveiled the new US stance in December 2017, declaring that he recognised Jerusalem as the capital of Israel.He said he had \"judged this course of action to be in the best interests of the United States of America, and the pursuit of peace between Israel and the Palestinians\".Guatemala then confirmed it would also make the shift to Jerusalem, and the Czech Republic reopened its honorary consulate in the city.Because it goes to the heart of the Israeli-Palestinian conflict.Mr Trump's decision to recognise Jerusalem as Israel's capital and move the US embassy was denounced by the Palestinians, who said it showed the US could not be a neutral mediator.UN member states also voted decisively at the General Assembly in favour of a resolution effectively calling the US declaration \"null and void\" and demanding it be cancelled.Israel regards Jerusalem as its \"eternal and undivided\" capital, while the Palestinians claim East Jerusalem - occupied by Israel in the 1967 Middle East war - as the capital of a future state.Israeli sovereignty over Jerusalem has never been recognised internationally, and according to the 1993 Israel-Palestinian peace accords, the final status of Jerusalem is meant to be discussed in the latter stages of peace talks.Since 1967, Israel has built a dozen settlements, home to about 200,000 Jews, in East Jerusalem. These are considered illegal under international law, though Israel disputes this.",

            "title": "Khan al-Ahmar: Israel court approves demolition of Bedouin village",
            "content": "Israel's Supreme Court has rejected appeals against the demolition of a Bedouin village in the occupied West Bank whose fate has been a subject of international concern.Judges upheld an order to raze Khan al-Ahmar, where about 180 people live in shacks between two Jewish settlements.Israel's government says the structures were built illegally, but Palestinians say permits are impossible to obtain.An injunction against the demolition will expire within seven days.The United Nations has called on Israel to allow the Bedouin to remain on the land, saying such demolitions are against international law.Khan al-Ahmar, which is 8km (5 miles) east of Jerusalem, was established in the early 1950s by members of a semi-nomadic tribe the UN says was displaced from the Negev desert in southern Israel.Israel did not recognise Khan al-Ahmar as a residential area after it occupied the West Bank during the 1967 Middle East war, and refused to connect the community to utilities like water and electricity.Since 2009, residents have been fighting demolition orders issued for the wooden and corrugated iron shacks in which they live, as well as a clinic, mosque and an Italian-funded primary school.The Israeli government said the structures were built on state-owned land without permits from the Israeli military which, under the 1993 Oslo Accords, has exclusive control over construction in the 60% of the West Bank known as \"Area C\".Palestinians complain that the Israeli military refuses the vast majority of Palestinian building requests and say they are left with little option except to build without permission.In May, the Supreme Court rejected petitions to prevent the demolitions at Khan al-Ahmar and the relocation of its residents to a site designated by the Israeli government near the Palestinian town of Abu Dis.After the Israeli military began preparations for the demolitions in July residents filed new petitions to the Supreme Court, including one asking for the original verdict to be overturned and another for the eviction to be delayed until they could find somewhere else to live.Israeli Defence Minister Avigdor Lieberman congratulated the court on Wednesday's ruling upholding the demolition order, which he said had come despite \"the orchestrated hypocrisy of Abu Mazen [Palestinian Authority President Mahmoud Abbas], the Left and European states\".\"Nobody is above the law, nobody will keep us from acting on our sovereignty and responsibility as a state,\" he added.The head of the Palestine Liberation Organisation's human rights body, Ahmed al-Tamimi, warned Israel against proceeding with the demolition, calling it a \"flagrant challenge to the whole world and a serious violation of the international humanitarian law and human rights\".The UN has previously warned that international humanitarian law requires an occupying power to protect the population of the territory that it occupies, ensure its welfare and wellbeing, as well as the respect for its human rights. Any destruction of property by the occupying power is prohibited, except when rendered absolutely necessary by military operations, the UN says. The extensive demolition of property is a grave breach of the Fourth Geneva Convention and may amount to a war crime, it adds. Other than for the security of the population or imperative military reasons, international humanitarian law also prohibits the transfer of the population of an occupied territory without the genuinely and fully informed consent of the affected people, according to the UN. Khan al-Ahmar is one of 18 Bedouin communities the UN considers being at risk of forcible transfer because they are located in or next to an area near East Jerusalem slated by Israel for Jewish settlement construction. The settlements are considered illegal under international law, though Israel disputes this.",

            "title": "Donald Trump denies discussing assassination of Syria's Assad",
            "content": "US President Donald Trump has denied assertions by prominent journalist Bob Woodward in his new book that he ordered the assassination of Syrian President Bashar al-Assad.Mr Trump said the idea was \"never even discussed\" with defence officials.Defence Secretary James Mattis has also denied words attributed to him in Woodward's book.The book Fear: Trump in the White House depicts a chaotic administration in a \"nervous breakdown of executive power\". Mr Trump has already condemned the new work as a \"con on the public\".In the book, senior aides are quoted as saying they hid sensitive documents to prevent Mr Trump signing them and as calling him an \"idiot\" and a \"liar\". Woodward is a widely respected, veteran journalist who helped expose President Richard Nixon's role in the Watergate scandal in the 1970s.A day after extracts of the book were published in the Washington Post, another daily the New York Times posted an opinion piece attributed to an unnamed senior White House official saying that the root of the administration's problems was Mr Trump's amorality.The official said many Trump appointees had vowed to thwart the president's \"more misguided impulses\".\"It may be cold comfort in this chaotic era, but Americans should know that there are adults in the room,\" the official adds. \"We fully recognise what is happening. And we are trying to do what's right even when Donald Trump won't.\"Later in the day, Mr Trump told a meeting of US sheriffs the \"gutless editorial\" in the \"failing New York Times\" was a \"disgrace\".His spokeswoman, Sarah Sanders, said in a statement about the unnamed writer: \"This coward should do the right thing and resign.\"The book says Mr Trump had ordered the Pentagon to arrange the assassination of the Syrian president after a chemical attack on civilians in April 2017 that was blamed on the Syrian government. \"Let's [expletive] kill him! Let's go in. Let's kill the [expletive] lot of them,\" Mr Trump is reported to have told Mr Mattis.The book says Mr Mattis acknowledged Mr Trump's request but then, after the conversation, told an aide he would not do \"any of that\".But speaking to journalists on Wednesday, the president said: \"That was never contemplated, nor would it be contemplated.\" He went on to describe the book as \"fiction\".Mr Trump sent out a series of tweets on Tuesday evening carrying his own views, along with statements from Mr Mattis, chief of staff John Kelly and White House spokeswoman Sarah Huckabee Sanders.The Woodward book has already been refuted and discredited by General (Secretary of Defense) James Mattis and General (Chief of Staff) John Kelly. Their quotes were made up frauds, a con on the public. Likewise other stories and quotes. Woodward is a Dem operative? Notice timing?End of Twitter post  by @realDonaldTrumpMr Trump says quotes attributed to Mr Mattis and Mr Kelly were \"made up frauds, a con on the public. Likewise other stories and quotes\".He says the book is \"already discredited\" with \"so many lies and phony sources\", rejecting an allegation that he had used the terms \"mentally retarded\" and \"dumb Southerner\" to describe Attorney General Jeff Sessions.The statement from Mr Mattis describes the book as \"a product of someone's rich imagination\".The statement from Mr Kelly says: \"The idea I ever called the president an idiot is not true... He always knows where I stand and he and I both know this story is total BS...\"Woodward says chief economic adviser Gary Cohn and White House staff secretary Rob Porter removed documents from the president's desk to keep Mr Trump from signing them.The documents would have allowed the president to withdraw from the North American Free Trade Agreement and a trade deal with South Korea.This amounts to an \"administrative coup d'état\", Woodward says.In other excerpts:",

            "title": "'All of you are at risk': Fears for journalism in Myanmar",
            "content": "The decision to sentence two Reuters reporters to seven years in prison for violating a state secrets act has sent shockwaves through the journalism community in Myanmar, the BBC's Nick Beake writes. For the journalists of Yangon this is personal. Many were close friends of the jailed Reuters reporters Wa Lone and Kyaw Soe Oo. And many now feel one false move and they could be joining them in the notorious Insein prison here in Myanmar's former capital.\"Insane\" is how the jail is pronounced and for many in the press, it reflects a chaotic legal farce which has played out over the past nine months. One that's culminated in two young journalists being found to have been useful to \"enemies of the state\" and handed a seven year prison sentence. Not that their wives regret their choice of careers. Not for one moment. \"I'm so proud of my husband\", Kyaw Soe Oo's wife, Chit Su Win, told a packed press conference in a downtown hotel. \"I am proud that I am the wife of a journalist.\"But what about those in Myanmar who agree with the judge that they harmed the country by seeking sensitive, security information? Pan Ei Mon, who gave birth to her first child last month while her husband Wa Lone was in jail replied: \"People are entitled to their own opinions. They have never gone through what we're going through. I just hope it never happens to them.\"And how about Aung San Suu Kyi? The country's Nobel peace prize-winning leader had accused the pair of breaking the Official Secrets Act before the verdict had even been delivered. \"I loved and respected her so much,\" Pan Ei Mon explained. \"But she said our husbands were not reporters because they violated the nation's secrets, and I am very devastated by that.\" Ms Suu Kyi used to champion the rights of journalists. She certainly benefited from their coverage of her long fight for democracy while she suffered years of house arrest. When it was time for my own question to the wives, I asked what their message to Ms Suu Kyi would be - as someone who the Burmese authorities had also kept apart from the man she loved (her late British husband Michael Aris).Chit Su Win told me she'd rather address her mother to mother.\"My daughter asks me - doesn't daddy love me anymore?  Doesn't daddy live with us anymore?\" \"As a mother, I feel devastated. I tell her daddy is working. I try to be strong for my daughter. I feel very depressed, but I steel myself, because if I am depressed, who will care for my daughter?\" As the mother of the nation, Ms Suu Kyi generated huge hope when her National League for Democracy (NLD) party triumphed in free elections in 2012, after five decades of brutal military rule. History will judge how misplaced that hope may have been. What's for sure in 2018, hope is a commodity that's fading fast. Not least because of the chorus of international condemnation of Myanmar over the army's persecution of Rohingya Muslims in Rakhine state - the very story the Reuters pair were investigating at the time of their arrest. They continue to argue they were framed because they were getting dangerously close to the truth of a massacre of 10 Rohingya men in the village of Inn Din. One of the many painful ironies of this case is that the army later admitted its soldiers were culpable.The military's wider crackdown on what it called Bengali \"terrorists\" last autumn - following attacks on security posts - forced three quarters of a million Rohingya into neighbouring Bangladesh. They remain there in the sprawling and depressing camps of Cox's Bazaar. Last week in a blistering assessment, UN inspectors said the top generals should stand trial for genocide and accused Ms Suu Kyi of failing to use her \"moral authority\" to stop the violence. Now Ms Suu Kyi's accused of failing to stand up for reporters, as well as the Rohingya. \"All of you are at risk,\" Khin Maung Zaw, the leading lawyer for the Reuters pair told the hushed room of journalists back at the press conference. He declared the verdict a black day for Myanmar and a major setback for a free press and the country's transition to democracy.  Many wonder who will be next. Aung Naing Soe is one Burmese journalist who knows what it's like to feel the heat of the regime in the new Suu Kyi era. Earlier this year he served a two month sentence for operating a drone near the parliament in the capital Naypyidaw. \"It's really heartbreaking for us to come and cover this kind of event\" he tells me. \"I do not want to see tears from the wives of these journalists anymore. We have covered a lot of heartbreaking things but this is more personal. They are my colleagues, my friends.\"He's worried that the public has been poisoned against journalists by online campaigns which characterise them as \"betrayers of the state\" and that there will be no popular backlash against any further attacks on the freedom of the press. In some countries, Wa Lone and Kyaw Soe Oo would have been given a prize for their investigative journalism. Not here. Not in Suu Kyi's Myanmar. As State Counsellor, a role she created for herself because the country's 2008 Constitution denies her the presidency, Ms Suu Kyi runs Myanmar's NLD civilian government. She has the power to issue a pardon and set these journalists free. If she's even considering that, she certainly hasn't shown it. Su Myat Mon is a reporter who focuses on women's rights and social affairs. \"I was extremely disappointed with the verdict and with the NLD too. They're a democratic government. They used to believe the media was for something, that it did something positive for democracy.\"Is she scared to be a journalist in Myanmar now?  \"It does make me frightened,\" she replies. \"I can be arrested at any time if the government doesn't like my reports. This verdict affects me: my emotions and the work I do.\"Would you consider giving up the job?, I venture. Su Myat Mon looks at me straight in the eye: \"I love this job. I may fear being arrested, but I still have my spirit. And, don't forget, there's nothing wrong with being a journalist. It is not a crime.\"",

            "title": "Amsterdam attack: Jihadist knifeman shot in nine seconds",
            "content": "A 19-year-old Afghan who stabbed two American tourists in Amsterdam was shot just nine seconds after he launched his attack, the city's police chief has revealed.Commissioner Pieter-Jaap Aalbersberg said a special \"spotter\" had been watching the suspect when he pulled out a knife at Amsterdam's central station.Moments later teenager Jawed S was shot in the hip, he said.The suspect's lawyer has revealed the man had expected to die in the attack.Jawed S, an asylum seeker who arrived in Germany in 2015, had travelled by train to Amsterdam on Friday. The German authorities say they were tipped off in February that he had become radicalised while living at a youth facility.\"My client appears to have made the assumption that he wasn't going to survive his attack, because a will was found at his home in Germany,\" said lawyer Simon van der Woude.He believed the teenager had been acting in response to a cartoon competition proposed by anti-Islam politician Geert Wilders, as well as an earlier video involving the Prophet Muhammad. Dutch prosecutors said this week that Jawed S had had a \"terrorist motive\" and had been \"of the opinion that in the Netherlands the Prophet Muhammad, Islam and the Koran were insulted\".Mr Wilders had cancelled the competition the day before the attack but Mr Van der Woude said his client did not appear to know.In a statement on Wednesday the two victims of the attack thanked Dutch police and praised hospital staff for delivering \"life altering news as gently as possible\".The Amsterdam police chief told Dutch TV that Jawed S had got off a train shortly before midday on Friday and a few minutes afterwards his \"abnormal behaviour\" had come to the notice of a member of a team of public transport police trained to spot pickpockets as well as potential terrorists.\"He called two colleagues over,\" said Mr Aalbersberg. \"While they are working out how to go and talk to him, they see he starts stabbing.\"One of the tourists was stabbed in the back at a kiosk before a second was attacked.The police, who were by now 20m (65ft) away, drew their weapons. As Jawed S ran towards another potential victim, an officer opened fire and brought him down.Within minutes, police had looked through CCTV images and determined that the man had been acting on his own.\"There were two victims and that is very serious, but the number was kept to a minimum,\" the commissioner said.\"Within nine seconds it was over and the officers made the difference during one precise moment,\" he added, stressing that they had saved lives. The attacker was apparently unaware his victims were Americans. US ambassador Pete Hoekstra told Dutch TV late on Tuesday that it was an \"attack on Western values\".Police say the central station in Amsterdam has long been identified as a potential target for attack and that they have a permanent team on duty.They adapted an Israeli approach called \"predictive profiling\" whereby a suspect can be identified through suspicious patterns of behaviour.\"First of all a spotter assesses what behaviour is normal in a particular place,\" police trainer Geoffrey Rijtslag told the Volkskrant newspaper.Anyone who deviated from that or started hanging around aimlessly was considered abnormal. At that point they would be approached by at least two officers.The Amsterdam police chief said there were other indicators that spotters would consider too. Anyone who was waiting for a train would normally be expected to look at departure boards.",

            "title": "Taliban threaten 70% of Afghanistan, BBC finds",
            "content": "Taliban fighters, whom US-led forces spent billions of dollars trying to defeat, are now openly active in 70% of Afghanistan, a BBC study has found.Months of research across the country shows that the Taliban now control or threaten much more territory than when foreign combat troops left in 2014.The Afghan government played down the report, saying it controls most areas.But recent attacks claimed by Taliban and Islamic State group militants have killed scores in Kabul and elsewhere. Afghan officials and US President Donald Trump have responded by ruling out any talks with the Taliban. Last year Mr Trump announced the US military would stay in the country indefinitely.The BBC research also suggests that IS is more active in Afghanistan than ever before, although it remains far less powerful than the Taliban. The BBC study shows the Taliban are now in full control of 14 districts (that's 4% of the country) and have an active and open physical presence in a further 263 (66%), significantly higher than previous estimates of Taliban strength. About 15 million people - half the population - are living in areas that are either controlled by the Taliban or where the Taliban are openly present and regularly mount attacks.  \"When I leave home, I'm uncertain whether I will come back alive,\" said one man, Sardar, in Shindand, a western district that suffers weekly attacks. \"Explosions, terror and the Taliban are part of our daily life.\"The extent to which the Taliban have pushed beyond their traditional southern stronghold into eastern, western and northern parts of the country is clearly visible from the BBC study. Areas that have fallen to the Taliban since 2014 include places in Helmand province like Sangin, Musa Qala and Nad-e Ali, which foreign forces fought and died to bring under government control after US-led troops had driven the Taliban from power in 2001. More than 450 British troops died in Helmand between 2001 and 2014.In the areas defined as having an active and open Taliban presence, the militants conduct frequent attacks against Afghan government positions. These range from large organised group strikes on military bases to sporadic single attacks and ambushes against military convoys and police checkpoints. Attacks registered during the research period happened with varying degrees of frequency - from once in three months (low Taliban presence) to twice a week (high Taliban presence).For the purposes of the investigation, districts controlled or held by the government are defined as having sitting representation from Kabul in the form of a district chief, police chief and courts. During the research period, the BBC study found 122 districts (just over 30% of the country) did not have an open Taliban presence. These areas are ranked as under government control, but that does not mean they were free of violence. Kabul and other major cities, for example, suffered major attacks - launched from adjacent areas, or by sleeper cells - during the research period, as well as before and after.Amruddin, who runs a local transport company, lives close to the front line in Baharak district in northern Badakhshan province, where the BBC monitored violence suggesting a medium Taliban presence.\"We live with constant fear. Whenever the government side starts fighting with the Taliban, we're caught in the crossfire, bringing life to a standstill.  It's quiet at the moment but the Taliban are still here.\"In Taliban-controlled Sangin, father of eight Mohammad Reza, described life as \"better\" under the militants because there was peace.\"It only got violent when the government forces arrived.\"Karim Haidari, BBC Afghan, KabulI haven't been sleeping well this week. It happens every time another tragedy hits our city. \"You look old, Dad,\" says my seven-year-old bouncing into my bedroom to remind me it's his birthday.  As if I would forget. I laugh and get up.As I leave the house I pause to look back at my family having breakfast. Will I make it back home today? Will this be the last time I see them? We all think like this in Kabul now.My BBC colleagues are waiting in the car. We swap news about the latest attack. One of them, a mother of two young children, starts sobbing. \"Sometimes I just wish I could blow myself up to end all this. But I don't want to hurt anyone else.\"  We can get you counselling if it would help, I say. But she's not listening. The driver switches on the radio, to try to change the mood. A pop song comes on with nonsensical lyrics. It's just another day in Kabul. Just another day of hoping we'll all stay alive. \"People have no choice but to leave their homes, farms and orchards or stay and live with Taliban rule,\" Mahgul, a teacher from a northern district in Kabul province, told the BBC. She said her family fled their village in October. They went to seek refuge in the government-controlled district centre, only for her brother to be killed there two days later by a suicide bomber. To the west of the capital, Jamila, a mother of five, said: \"Two Taliban rockets landed in our back garden last month. We live just a few hundred metres from the district chief office. It's not safe here.\"During the investigation, evidence of a hike in Taliban taxation across the country was also uncovered. In districts where they are openly present, the militants force farmers, local businesses and even commercial goods convoys to pay them tax while still leaving it to the government to foot the bill for basic services such as schools and hospitals.\"They are charging people for the electricity that we supply!\" one chief of a southern district reported. The BBC's research has been reviewed by the Kabul-based Afghanistan Analysts Network, which has been reporting on Afghanistan since 2009.Co-Director Kate Clark said: \"Such a well-researched investigation into the Afghan war is rare and very welcome. The findings are shocking, but unfortunately not surprising - they ring true as an accurate mapping of the extent of the conflict. \"But it is disturbing to realise that each bit of orange shading on the map translates into lives lost and damaged.\" Violence has soared since international combat troops left Afghanistan three years ago. More than 8,500 civilians were killed or injured in the first three-quarters of 2017, according to the UN. Final figures for the year are awaited. The vast majority of Afghans die in insurgent violence but civilians often suffer as the military, with US backing, fights back, both on the ground and from the air.Although much of the violence goes unreported, big attacks in the cities tend to make the headlines. Such attacks are occurring with greater frequency and the Afghan security forces appear unable to stop them.During the research period, gunmen stormed the headquarters of Kabul's Shamshad TV, leaving one staff member dead and 20 wounded. IS said it carried out the attack. There were other attacks in Kandahar, Herat and Jalalabad.In the last 10 days of January three attacks left the capital reeling, with more than 130 people dead. Last May, Kabul experienced the deadliest single militant attack since 2001. At least 150 people were killed and more than 300 injured when a massive truck bomb was detonated in what was supposed to be the safest part of the city. No group has said it carried out the attack.The rising toll of violence has left the capital's residents feeling increasingly vulnerable. While Islamic State has shown they can hit targets in places like Kabul, they are largely confined to a relatively small stronghold on the border with Pakistan in the eastern province of Nangarhar.During the research period at least 50 people were assassinated in the provincial capital, Jalalabad. Some of the victims were shot dead and others blown up. Three were beheaded, a hallmark of killings by IS.\"My uncle was assassinated on his doorstep,\" said businessman Mashriqiwal. \"He was a city security official. I had to leave Jalalabad. My home is still there but it is just too dangerous to live in and go out in public.\"Local people and officials the BBC spoke to said IS now has a presence in 30 districts - not just in the east but also in places like Khanabad and Kohistanat in the north. The group is fighting both the Afghan military and the Taliban for territorial control. During 2017 the number of attacks attributed to the group increased, with many targeting urban centres and often Shia Muslims in sectarian attacks almost never seen before in Afghanistan's 40-year conflict.IS does not fully control any district at present. However the group has seized parts of the northern district of Darzab, displacing hundreds of people from their homes.Gathering accurate and reliable data on the conflict has been getting harder since foreign combat troops pulled out and handed responsibility for security to Afghan forces. Previous assessments of Taliban strength have not always had access to information from every district of the country, and have often carried the caveat they may have underestimated the real situation.The BBC investigation - conducted during late 2017 - provides a rare snapshot of the security situation in every Afghan district between 23 August and 21 November. A network of BBC reporters across Afghanistan spoke to more than 1,200 individual local sources, in every one of the  country's 399 districts, to build up a comprehensive picture of all militant attacks over that period.These conversations happened either in person or by telephone and all information was checked with at least two and often as many as six other sources. In some cases BBC reporters even went to local bus stations to find people travelling in from remote and inaccessible districts in order to double check the situation there.Presented with the BBC's findings, President Ashraf Ghani's spokesman Shah Hussain Murtazavi said: \"In some districts areas may change hands. But if you look at the situation this year [2017/18] the activities of the Taliban and IS have been considerably curtailed. \"The Afghan security forces have won the war in the villages.  It is no longer possible for the militants to take control of a province, a major district or a highway. There's no doubt that they have changed the nature of the war and are launching attacks on Kabul, targeting mosques and bazaars.\"He added: \"My understanding is that the BBC report is influenced by conversations with people who may have experienced some kind of incident maybe for an hour in one day. But the activities and services provided by our local administrations across the districts show that the government is in control in the absolute majority of districts - except for a handful where the Taliban are present.\"However, in an acknowledgement of how far security has deteriorated, President Trump agreed last year to deploy 3,000 more soldiers, taking the size of the US force in Afghanistan to about 14,000. The subject of militant gains and territorial control is disputed. On the eve of the publication of the BBC study, the US military denied trying to prevent a government watchdog from disclosing the amount of Afghan territory believed to be under the control of the Taliban. In its latest report the Special Inspector General for Afghanistan Reconstruction (Sigar) had said it found the move troubling. Meanwhile, there is no prospect of an end to the conflict and a new generation of Afghans live in the shadow of violence. \"My kids are not safe outside the family home so I don't let them out,\" said Pahlawan, a Kabul carpet seller with 13 children.  \"They are basically under house arrest.  I have built them a school in my warehouse. Their world is walls and carpets. Although we are in Kabul, it's like raising them in a jungle.\" Data journalism by Will Dahlgreen.

            "content": "The parents of a student who died in a hazing incident at a US university last year have reached a settlement with the college social club responsible.Timothy Piazza, 19, died that February after suffering injuries at a \"pledge\" event for a fraternity at Pennsylvania State University.The amount of the settlement will remain private, US media say. The fraternity has also agreed to reforms.The family can still continue with suits against individual defendants.Jim and Evelyn Piazza's settlement with the Beta Theta Pi fraternity's national organisation mandates that all chapters be alcohol- and substance-free by August 2020, ABC News reports.It is part of a 17-point conduct reform programme \"aimed at averting another preventable death\".Any decisions about the now-closed chapter house at Penn State will also need Mr and Mrs Piazza's approval.A resolution banning hard alcohol at any chapter events, nationwide, was approved by 66 fraternities following outrage over alcohol-related student deaths.The policy will be adopted by 1 September of next year in 6,100 chapters on 800 campuses.Beta Theta Pi chairman S Wayne Kay said in a statement that Timothy's death remained \"one of the greatest disappointments and darkest hours in Beta's history\".Fraternity member Ryan Burke, 21, pleaded guilty to hazing and unlawful acts in June. He was sentenced to three months of house arrest, 100 hours of community service and thousands of dollars in fines.Twenty-five defendants still face charges over Timothy's death. Last month, a Pennsylvania judge tossed out the most serious charges - involuntary manslaughter and reckless endangerment -  after prosecutors refiled them.Timothy Piazza, a second-year engineer student from Lebanon, New Jersey, attended an initiation ritual at the fraternity house on 2 February. Throughout the evening, Timothy and other students participated in binge-drinking activities before he fell down a flight of stairs. In a group text message just before midnight, one of the fraternity members wrote: \"Also, Tim Piazza might actually be a problem. He fell 15 feet down a flight of stairs, hair-first, going to need help.\"After the fall he was slapped in the face, shaken and thrown on to a couch, where he remained for most of the night, according to a grand jury report.In the early hours of 3 February, members of the fraternity carried him to another couch after finding him on a basement floor with blood on his face, the report said. Nearly 12 hours later, a fraternity member called an ambulance.Timothy died the next day of traumatic brain injury.",

She was found in a critical condition by other crew members aboard the Mayan Queen IV last week and died while being airlifted to hospital.Her body is now due to be flown home to Australia by her family, who had been on their way to visit her. Greek police have said they do not believe her death was suspicious and have since allowed the boat to leave the island of Kefalonia, where it had been docked. The super-yacht is owned by Mexican mining magnate Alberto Bailleres, who is reported to have left the vessel days before her death.The Greek coroner's office has confirmed to several media outlets that there were no signs of violence on her body but added that toxicology results were pending. Ms McNamara, originally from Port Macquarie in New South Wales, regularly posted pictures of her travels to her Instagram account, where she had thousands of followers. Her mother and sister were on their way to Greece to visit her when they received news of her death, reports say.Fans and friends have paid tribute to Ms McNamara online in the days since her death.

            "content": "Amazon founder Jeff Bezos has donated $10m (£7.8m) to an independent political action group (super PAC) focused on electing military veterans.Mr Bezos and his wife contributed to With Honor, a fund promoting veterans in Congress instead of a specific political party, the group confirmed.Ranked the world's richest man, Mr Bezos has not been an active political campaign donor thus far, US media say.He has said his main focus has been on long-term investments over charity.The donation was the largest the group has received this year, according to Ellen Zeng, political director for the With Honor fund.She told Reuters the group wants to equally split its spending between Democrat and Republican candidates. Mr Bezos, who also owns the Washington Post and and aerospace company Blue Origin, last made a sizeable donation in 2012, when he donated $2.5m to support same-sex marriage in Washington state.According to Forbes, Mr Bezos is worth around $112bn.With Honor is considered a super PAC, or a category of independent political action group that is allowed to accept and spend unlimited amounts of corporate, individual or union cash on behalf of a candidate.Current candidates, according to With Honor's website, include: Nearly 200 veterans are running for seats in the US House of Representatives this year, according to the fund. In total, the fund has endorsed 33 candidates running for congressional seats - 14 Republicans and 19 Democrats.The group's founder, Rye Barcott, told the Wall Street Journal that Mr Bezos and his wife \"perceive themselves to be pretty nonpartisan\".\"The idea of doing something different and disruptive appealed to them, along with our focus on values and integrity in our national discourse,\" Mr Barcott said.According to federal election data viewed by the Journal, the Bezos family has given $31,000 to Democratic candidates and $21,600 to Republican candidates since 2007.Mr Bezos joins fellow billionaires Sheldon Adelson, a casino magnate, and Tom Steyer, a philanthropist, in spending millions to back super PACs and candidates.Mr Adelson has been a notable contributor to the Republican party - this May, he gave $30m to a super PAC aiming to keep the Republican majority in the House.Just behind the casino magnate in donations, is Mr Steyer, a hedge fund manager worth around $1.6b, who has contributed $29.5m to pro-Democrat PACs as well as his own super PAC against President Donald Trump, Need to Impeach.Hedge fund founder George Soros has donated over $10m to super PACs promoting Democratic candidates.Conservative billionaire Robert Mercer gave millions to Mr Trump' campaign in 2016, and according to the Center for Responsive Politics, spent $2m funding a far-right nonprofit targeting voters via social media.Over 60% of all PAC contributions come from donors giving more than $500,000, the Washington Post reported, which means a handful of the wealthiest Americans have a large impact on political campaigns. In the 2016 election, mega donors led super PACs to raise over $1bn for candidates.",

            "content": "A judge has declared a mistrial in the case of a former Blackwater security guard accused of inciting a firefight that killed 14 Iraqi civilians in 2007.The jury remained deadlocked in the trial of Nicholas Slatten, who was charged with first-degree murder for allegedly firing the first shots.The case was a retrial, after a court ruled Slatten should not have been tried alongside three other guards.Neither Slatten nor prosecutors have commented on Wednesday's ruling.US District Judge Royce Lamberth in Washington DC declared a mistrial after the jury of seven men and five women could not reach a unanimous verdict.The jury had deliberated for 16 days, even asking Judge Lamberth last week to advise them, the Washington Post reported. The judge gave them until Tuesday to make a decision.Prosecutors charged Slatten, who was a former Army sniper, with murder as his case had passed the time limit for manslaughter charges.First-degree murder charges, however, have a higher burden of proof.During the retrial, prosecutors alleged Slatten, 34, fired first, sparking the violence that left 14 dead. They accused Slatten of hating Iraqis and starting the firefight as an act of revenge for the 9/11 terrorist attacks, USA Today reported.The defence retaliated by saying Slatten was innocent, especially as another Blackwater guard - Paul Slough - had initially confessed to firing the first shots.According to prosecutors, Slough was inconsistent - at first, he denied that he started the firefight, then changed his statement and said he had.Dane Butswinkas, an attorney for Slatten, said the government's case was made up of \"guesswork, speculation and conjecture\".The Justice Department has not commented regarding retrying the case, US media say.The Post reported that many jurors stayed after the mistrial ruling to speak with attorneys for Slatten and the government about the case.In Baghdad's Nisoor Square in 2007, the Blackwater security guards opened fire while escorting a US convoy. Fourteen civilians died and another 17 were injured. The men claimed they were under fire from insurgents.The firefight ignited an international debate over the role of defence contractors and strained US-Iraq relations.Since 2008, the cases of these Blackwater employees have been in and out of the courts. Dozens of survivors and relatives of those killed by the shooting have testified in the US during the course of the proceedings.Slatten and his colleagues Paul Slough, Dustin Heard and Evan Liberty were convicted in 2014 and sentenced the following year. Slatten received a life sentence for murder while the other three were jailed for multiple counts of manslaughter, attempted manslaughter and using firearms while committing a felony.A panel of judges on the US Court of Appeals later ruled 2-1 that the sentencing - 30 years each - for Slough, Heard and Liberty violated the constitution as \"cruel and unusual punishment\" and that they should be resentenced.Last year, a court ordered a retrial for Slatten, saying he should not have been tried alongside the three other security guards who were convicted for the Baghdad incident as Slough initially claimed he had fired the first shots.",

            "content": "Eleven Latin American countries say that they have agreed to allow Venezuelans leaving their homeland to enter their countries even if their travel documents have expired. More than 2.3 million Venezuelans have fled the country's hyperinflation and severe shortages.But many do not have valid passports because renewing them can take years.The move will come as a relief to those who say they were trapped in Venezuela due to their lack of papers.Venezuelan President Nicolás Maduro has repeatedly mocked those who leave, saying they \"fall for propaganda only to leave and clean toilets in Miami\".The announcement was made after a two-day meeting of migration officials from Latin America in the Ecuadorean capital, Quito.Eleven of the countries represented signed a joint declaration in which they also called on the Venezuelan government to speed up the process of issuing passports.Venezuelans have long complained about how difficult it is to get hold of passports and other official documents such as birth and marriage certificates and ID cards.Many have reported being asked for bribes up to $1,000 (£780) for a passport which could rise to $5,000 if the applicant had urgent reasons to leave, such as wanting to visit a sick family member abroad. The government has blamed shortages of paper and \"mafias\" inside the registry service, known as Saime, for the delays. In June, four Saime officials were arrested for extortion and a new director of the service was named in July. But with tens of thousands of Venezuelans wanting to leave, the queues remain long.The countries which will allow Venezuelans to enter with expired papers are: Argentina, Brazil, Chile, Colombia, Costa Rica, Ecuador, Mexico, Panama, Paraguay, Peru and Uruguay.The Latin American countries which have seen the biggest influx say they have been struggling to deal with the high numbers of Venezuelans crossing into their territory. Last month, Ecuador started demanding Venezuelans show valid passports at the border, a measure which was later overturned by a court because it contravened a regional agreement on free travel.Peru followed suit but children, pregnant women and children remained exempt from the requirement. Thousands of Venezuelans rushed to Peru's northern border to enter the country before the measure came into effect.The Venezuelan government has denied there is a migration crisis and said \"enemy countries\" had inflated the number of those leaving to justify an invasion.",

            "title": "US 2018 mid-terms in charts: Should Donald Trump be worried?",
            "content": "Donald Trump won't be on the ballot when Americans go to the polls on 6 November, but the elections will shape the rest of his presidency. Voters will be choosing 35 senators, 36 state governors and all 435 members of the House of Representatives, as well as dozens of local legislative officials.The elections matter because if Democrats take back control of the House or the Senate from Republicans, they could severely limit what President Trump can do in the final two years of his term. In the House, analysts predict dozens of seats could change hands and the majority of these are currently held by Republicans. Republicans are well positioned in the battle for the Senate though as only nine of their seats are up for election, while Democrats are defending 24 of theirs and two independents who vote with them are also up.  Mid-term elections tend to act as a referendum on the president and that's usually bad news for the party that controls the White House. Of the 21 mid-terms that have been held since 1934, the president's party has only made gains in the House three times and in the Senate five times. The president's approval rating is a good indicator for how his party will do and President Trump's is historically low, hovering around 40%. For comparison, President Obama's was at 45% before the 2010 mid-terms in which the Democrats saw some of the biggest electoral losses in US history.Generic ballot polling, which tracks which party voters say they will back, doesn't offer much reassurance to Republicans either. It currently shows the Democrats up by about 10 percentage points - the party's biggest lead since the start of the year.Can we tell now if Democrats will win?The average age of Congress is 60, so members retiring shouldn't come as a big surprise. But the number of Republicans who are bowing out rather than contesting the mid-terms has raised eyebrows. More than 30 Republicans have announced their retirement - many more have resigned, a few due to sexual harassment accusations, while some are leaving to pursue other elected offices. Many of those quitting have cited the highly partisan climate and Donald Trump as a reason, with one telling CNN: \"I feel all I do is answer questions about Donald Trump rather than health insurance or tax policy.\"It's good news for Democrats as studies have shown that incumbent candidates are more likely to win an election than their challengers, due in part to greater name recognition and fundraising capability.The Democrats have seen a major boost in recruitment thanks to Donald Trump and this year will be the first time they've fielded more candidates for the House than Republicans since 2008.  About 1,500 people have stood as Democrats in House primaries - 500 more than in the last mid-terms - and within that there's also a record 350 women.The big jump in the number of women candidates has led some pundits to predict that 2018 could become another \"Year of the Woman\" - a reference to the 1992 mid-terms in which the number of women in Congress doubled. As it stands, women make up only 20% of Congress and this underrepresentation has long been put down to a reluctance by women to run for office. But Hillary Clinton's surprise defeat to Donald Trump, a man who has been accused of sexual harassment and has a long history of making sexist remarks, appears to have been a galvanising moment for American women.The women lining up to topple TrumpMid-term elections don't have the excitement that a presidential contest brings, meaning turnout is lower. While around 60% of Americans vote for the president, only around 40% take part in the mid-terms. In 2014, it was just 35.9% - the lowest mid-terms turnout since the Second World War, according to the United States Elections Project.Low turnout has tended to favour the Republican Party in previous mid-terms as those that do vote are older and whiter than in presidential elections.Democrats are hopeful Mr Trump's unpopularity with younger, female and minority voters will encourage them to take more notice of mid-terms this time around.  In March, 1 million people voted in the Democratic primary in Texas - nearly double the amount that did so four years ago - but that still fell short of the 1.5 million Republicans who voted. While that means Texas might be out of reach for Democrats, similar turnout in other states could help turn them blue. President Trump's biggest legislative victory so far has been his sweeping overhaul of the US tax system, but he was only able to sign that into law because Republicans have majorities in both houses of Congress.If Democrats win control of one or both of those houses in November, they'll be able to limit how much President Trump can achieve in the final two years of his term.Democrats could take control of important Congressional committees, which would allow them to launch oversight investigations into several issues, including the president's business dealings and allegations of sexual assault made against him.While calls for Mr Trump's impeachment are likely to get louder if Democrats take control of the House, it could ultimately be fruitless unless Republican senators turn on the president due to the two-thirds majority needed in the Senate to remove him from office. Only two presidents have ever been impeached - Andrew Johnson and Bill Clinton - and both were acquitted after a trial in the Senate. Richard Nixon resigned before he could be impeached after the Watergate scandal.Democrats may have a better chance of removing President Trump by defeating him in the next presidential election in 2020.

            "title": "Elon Musk in new rant at Thai cave rescuer",
            "content": "Elon Musk has again attacked a British diver he has previously accused without evidence of being a child abuser.In an email to a reporter, Mr Musk said Vernon Unsworth - who assisted with the rescue of 12 Thai teenagers from a flooded cave - was a \"child rapist\".Mr Unsworth's lawyer said the allegation was \"completely false\".Mr Musk had earlier apologised for calling Mr Unsworth a \"pedo\". The pair first clashed over Mr Musk's offer of a mini-submarine to help with the rescue.The Briton had told CNN that the submarine was \"just a PR stunt [that] had absolutely no chance of working\". The Tesla founder responded with a series of tweets accusing Mr Unsworth of paedophilia without providing any evidence.In July he deleted the tweets but last week he appeared to repeat his allegation, tweeting that it was \"strange he hasn't sued me\" after Mr Unsworth said he was considering legal action.Writing in an email to Buzzfeed reporter Ryan Mac, Mr Musk went further. He told the reporter to \"call people you know in Thailand, find out what's actually going on and stop defending child rapists\".He alleged that Mr Unsworth, 63, had spent decades visiting and living in Thailand and had recently moved to Chiang Rai in northern Thailand \"for a child bride who was about 12 years old at the time\".\"It isn't where you'd go for caves, but it is where you'd go for something else,\" Mr Musk wrote. \"Chiang Rai is renowned for child sex trafficking.\" He added that he hoped Mr Unsworth would sue him.Mr Unsworth's lawyer Mark Stephens from the firm Howard Kennedy told the BBC that Mr Musk's allegations were baseless.\"Just as we get a series of legal proceedings drafted, Mr Musk adds another libel to it,\" he said.\"He seems to have a reckless indifference about the truth of these things. There's not a shred or scintilla of evidence to back it up. \"Vernon Unsworth is in most people's minds a hero. He is not a paedophile as is alleged. We feel very strongly that the record should be put straight.\"\"This is all about being upset that - as one of the divers, not my client, put it - Musk's shiny tube wasn't used,\" he added.Mr Stephens confirmed that Mr Unsworth was in a relationship with Woranan Ratrawiphukkun, a Thai woman who told Buzzfeed she was 40 and had been in a relationship with Mr Unsworth for seven years.The couple had met in London, where Mr Unsworth lives, and the relationship had continued while Mr Unsworth was in Thailand exploring the Tham Luang cave complex, Mr Stephens said.In his email, Mr Musk also said that Mr Unsworth had not been part of the cave dive rescue team and had been shunned by its members.Mr Unsworth did not take part in the dives but had previously explored the cave complex extensively. He knew about the raised ledge known as Pattaya Beach where the boys and their football coach could have sought shelter, travelled into the caves shortly after they went missing and called in the two expert British divers who eventually found the trapped group.Several divers told Buzzfeed that he had worked continuously on the rescue. \"He was pivotal to the entire operation,\" said British diver Rick Stanton.Mr Musk also sent a copy of a letter from the Thai government thanking him for his offer of assistance and denied that he had been asked by the Thai government to leave the cave complex during the rescue operation - an assertion he alleged Mr Unsworth had made during his CNN interview. In the interview, Mr Unsworth said Mr Musk had been asked to leave the cave complex during the rescue operation but did not say by whom.Mr Stephens said Mr Musk had not initially asked for or been given surveys of the cave system when offering the use of a mini-submarine and it would not have fitted through the spaces available in the cave anyway. Mr Musk only arrived at the cave complex when eight of the boys had already been rescued, Mr Stephens said. The latest controversy follows weeks of erratic behaviour on social media.In July he shocked investors by announcing on Twitter that he had funding secured to take his car firm Tesla private. He later said the firm would stay public.He also tweeted that he suffered from \"great highs, terrible lows and unrelenting stress\". He also tweeted that he might suffer from bipolar disorder but then said \"maybe not medically\".In August he told the New York Times that he worked \"120-hour weeks\" and took sedatives.His brother Kimbal Musk told the newspaper that the reason Mr Musk \"seems to attract drama\" is because he is \"so transparent, so open, in a way that can come back to bite him\".",

The BBC's Vikas Pandey explains what's at stake.The meetings between the US officials and their counterparts Nirmala Sitharaman and Sushma Swaraj - described as the 2+2 dialogue - are taking place against a backdrop of recent strains between Washington and Delhi. Meetings were first scheduled in April, but had to be rescheduled after US President Donald Trump fired his then Secretary of State Rex Tillerson. The dialogue was suspended once again in July for what India's foreign ministry described as \"unavoidable reasons\". Much has changed between the two strategic allies in recent months.The US has objected to new defence deals between India and Russia, and has also warned Delhi against importing crude oil from Iran. Both Moscow and Tehran are currently under US sanctions.Mr Trump's reported mocking of Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi's accent hasn't gone down well with Indian diplomats. And the unpredictable nature of the Trump administration has also made India's diplomats cautious.Washington and Delhi mostly enjoyed warm relations during former US presidents George Bush and Barack Obama's stints at the White House. But it's too soon to say the same about the Trump administration.Pratyush Rao, associate director for India and South Asia at Control Risks consultancy, said India needs to adopt \"cautious optimism\" in the talks.\"For India, which won a number of special favours under the Bush and Obama administrations - notably the civil nuclear deal and waivers on its oil trade with Iran - the real challenge will be how it now copes with the highly transactional nature of the Trump presidency,\" he told the BBC.It's true that Mr Modi invested a lot of time and energy in India-US ties. He has said on many occasions that Mr Obama was his friend, and he liked working with him.But the world diplomatic order has changed. The new US administration has shown that it can take unpredictable decisions - like Mr Trump's summit with North Korea's leader or deciding to walk out from the 2015 Paris climate agreement, and withdraw from a nuclear agreement with Iran.\"Indian diplomats will have these surprising decisions in mind when they negotiate deals with the US,\" Mr Rao says.India - which makes very few of its own weapons - is the world's biggest defence buyer, and Russia supplies most of its military equipment and spare parts.The US wants to change the dynamics. It has increased its arms exports to India more than five times in the past five years, taking its share in Delhi defence procurement to 15%.In comparison, Russia's share has fallen from 79% to 62% over the past five years, according to a study by the Stockholm International Peace Research Institute. Washington has traditionally not objected to India buying defence equipment from Russia.\"The US has long believed that India needs to be strong militarily to counter China in the region - even if it comes at the cost of Delhi buying arms from Russia,\" says Mr Rao.But the relationship has become more complicated under the Trump administration. India is in the process of acquiring S-400 air defence missiles from Russia. Delhi was expecting Washington to grant a waiver to India to go ahead with the deal.However, a top US official recently said a waiver was not guaranteed, and Washington was opposed to Delhi signing new deals with Russian firms hit by US sanctions.\"I can't sit here and tell you that they [India] would be exempt, that we would use that waiver - that will be the decision of the president if he is faced with a major new platform and capability that India has acquired from Russia,\" Randall Schriver, assistant secretary of defence for Asian and Pacific security affairs, said.Indian diplomats have hinted that India would not back out from the Russia deal because the air defence system was crucial for its security.It's not surprising that the deal is likely to be top of the agenda on Thursday.But Dr Stuti Banerjee, senior analyst at the Indian Council of World Affairs think-tank, said the leaders would look to find a solution.\"The two countries will take a hard stand on the issue. However, they have no other option but to find a solution. There is some confusion on different issues between the two countries, but there is no mistrust,\" she said.Some positives are also expected from the talks.The two sides are likely to make progress in talks to sign the Communications Compatibility and Security Agreement.The deal aims to improve co-ordination and communication between the militaries of the two countries.The US has also said that it was against India buying crude oil from Iran.  But Delhi may find it difficult to agree to the demand, something Ms Banerjee says India \"cannot afford\".India has pledged to invest more than $500m (£390m) to develop a port in Iran's Chabahar city. The port will give India access to central Asian countries to boost trade.\"Iran is an important strategic partner for India. Stopping oil imports will upset Tehran. However, India may agree to cut down on the amount it imports,\" she said.But that will largely depend on how the US sees India's position.\"Whether or not the US would be willing to insulate India from sanctions and other headwinds has potential consequences for how bilateral relations shape up over the next few years, including in the Indo-Pacific,\" Mr Rao says.The two countries also differ on their strategies in Afghanistan.A top US general recently said that Washington was open to holding direct talks with the Taliban.\"But India has always been cautious about direct talks with the Taliban. Since it's one of the biggest aid donors to Afghanistan, Delhi would want to have a say in how the peace process unfolds in the country. And it may not feel at ease if the US holds talks with some groups that Delhi believes are backed by Pakistan,\" she said.Trade is likely to be down the agenda, but some outstanding issues could be discussed.The US increased tariffs on Indian steel and aluminium earlier in the year. India retaliated and raised import duties on a number of products imported from the US.",

She was tortured and her body was burnt with acid, they added.The stepmother was allegedly upset as the girl was her father's favourite.Police told BBC Urdu that the girl had been missing for 10 days before they found her body. \"It was found that the stepmother had been nursing a grudge against the second wife of her husband, and her children,\" the NDTV news website quoted senior police officer Mir Imtiyaz Hussain as saying.Mr Hussain said the girl was killed with an axe after the gang rape. He said one of the accused, a 19-year-old man, mutilated her body. This is the second deadly rape in Indian-administered Kashmir in recent months. In April, an eight-year-old Muslim girl from Kathua district was gang raped and murdered. It prompted national outrage after two ministers from the Hindu nationalist Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) attended a rally in support of the accused men, who are Hindu.Scrutiny of sexual violence has grown in India since the 2012 gang rape and murder of a 23-year-old student on a bus in the capital Delhi.The crime sparked days of protests and forced the government to introduce tougher anti-rape laws, including the death penalty.However, attacks against women and children continue to be reported across the country.",

            "content": "A Canadian court has dismissed a Bigfoot-believer's lawsuit claiming British Columbia failed in its duty to recognise that sasquatches exist. Todd Standing tried to get the province to acknowledge that the giant, ape-like figure was \"an indigenous mammal living within British Columbia\".He also claimed the province infringed on his fundamental rights regarding his concern for the creature. The province argued the civil claim lacked \"an air of reality\". In a recent decision, British Columbia Supreme Court Justice Kenneth Ball found no reasonable cause for the lawsuit and said the court had no power to compel the province to conduct scientific investigations of its flora and fauna. The judge also dismissed the claim that Mr Standing's rights were being violated, stating that the province had never placed restrictions on his Bigfoot-related interests. The \"non-acknowledgement of the sasquatch does not in any way prohibit or restrict the plaintiff's ability to express his thoughts, beliefs, and opinions regarding the sasquatch,\" the decisions states. \"Not revealing 'specific locations where sasquatch sightings occur' is the decision of the plaintiff, and in no way infringes upon his ability to espouse his beliefs regarding sasquatch existence.\" Mr Standing, who has made a documentary film about Bigfoot researchers and the creature that many people believe is mythical, was also ordered to pay for the province's legal costs. He has previously said he had plans to file lawsuits in other jurisdictions in Canada and the US where the sasquatch is believed to live. ",

            "content": "\"I hope you develop an incurable case of boils in your crotch region.\" Paints quite the picture doesn't it? This was the sentiment Shannon Loys expressed to the thief who stole a bike belonging to her husband, who has survived cancer three times.Fuelled by rage, she made a poster addressed to the \"steaming pile of garbage bike thief\" in the hope it would lead to its return.What happened next has provoked a heart-warming reaction on social media.With the help of a kind-hearted homeless man called Kevin, her husband Andrew again has his bike, which had been specially adapted to meet his physical needs. It seems the tirade on the poster - and the thought of developing boils - did the trick, with Kevin admitting to Mrs Loys it scared the thief and that's how it came into his possession.She told the BBC: \"I put the flyer up to vent to the universe. I was upset. \"It was from the heart and gut-punching.\"But it was not as simple as a quick return, because first Mrs Loys had to find Kevin.After seeing the fearsome flyer, he had asked a woman to call the number on the poster and explain he had the bike and wanted Mrs Loy's husband to get it back as \"he's had a rough time\".But all Mrs Loys had to go on was that Kevin had been outside a Fred Meyer shop in Fremont in Seattle on Sunday night with a cart attached to his own bike. And so her quest began. Unable to sleep after the call at 23:00 PST (07:00 BST) and with a description of Kevin being her only other lead, Mrs Loys got up and drove down to the shop to find him.\"I thought it was probably a wild goose chase but I decided to see if there was anything in it. I had no other leads,\" she said.After a few loops of the area and reaching some dead ends, she stumbled across a homeless encampment and approached it, asking for \"the guy with the bicycle cart\".A little while later, and after rejecting the offer of some drugs and confirming she was not with the police, Kevin appeared with \"a big smile flashed across his face\".\"We all peered into the back of the cart and there was, to my absolute shock, my husband's bike,\" said Mrs Loys.\"He was so convinced it was my bike. I was sceptical. I was not expecting to get it back. It was not until I saw the pedal I knew.\"Kevin was so sweet. He had clearly been guarding it. He was on a mission to get it back to us.\"I don't know who stole my husband's bike, but I know for sure it was Kevin who gave it back.\"Describing the moment she returned home with the bike, Mrs Loys told the BBC: \"I turned the light on and woke up Andrew and was holding his bike. \"He has had some bad luck in his life...so getting it back meant more than the bike itself.\"She shared her story on Reddit, and it has had more than 20,000 upvotes and provoked a warm reaction.The couple have also had an offer from a well-wisher to pay for the bike's repairs.As for Kevin, the couple went back to the camp and gave him $100 (£78), a hot coffee, some food and a thank you card.\"He was as nice as I remembered, really sweet,\" she added.\"He was so worried someone would think he stole it.\"By Katie Thompson, UGC & Social News ",

            "title": "Trump senior official: 'I am part of the resistance'",
            "content": "An unnamed senior Trump official has said members of the administration are working to frustrate parts of the president's agenda to protect the country from his \"worst inclinations\".In a New York Times editorial, the author said President Trump's \"amorality\" and \"impulsiveness\" had led to ill-informed and reckless decisions. Mr Trump labelled the anonymous writer \"gutless\" and the newspaper as \"phony\". His press secretary said the mystery writer was a \"coward\" who should quit.The opinion piece comes a day after excerpts of Bob Woodward's book on the Trump White House suggested that his top officials have been engaged in an \"administrative coup d'etat\" to protect the nation from the president, including removing key documents from his desk before he has a chance to sign them. This, then, presents itself as first-hand acknowledgement that the coup is real. TREASON?End of Twitter post  by @realDonaldTrumpThe author says that he/she isn't a liberal operative and agrees with many of the policy goals the administration is pursuing, but that those goals are being achieved in spite of - and not because of - the president.The laundry list of criticisms should be familiar to the president's opponents on the left and the right, however. Disorganised meetings, an impetuous and petty demeanour, an inability to stick to decisions, antipathy to a free press and \"anti-democratic\" instincts.He/she describes a \"two-track presidency\", where the president's actions - such as his conciliatory attitude toward \"autocrats and dictators\", including Kim Jong-un and Vladimir Putin - are constrained and redirected by \"adults in the room\".\"This isn't the work of the so-called deep state,\" the author writes. \"It's the work of the steady state.\"What's more, the author says that some in the administration have whispered about invoking the 25th Amendment, a constitutional provision that allows the vice-president and a majority of the Cabinet secretaries to vote to remove a president who is \"unable to discharge the powers and duties of his office\". Such a manoeuvre has been, up until now, largely consigned to the fringes of American political discourse and the fever dreams of Mr Trump's angriest opponents.   \"No one wanted to precipitate a constitutional crisis,\" he/she writes. \"So we will do what we can to steer the administration in the right direction until - one way or another - it's over.\"There has already been talk of an aggressive push within the White House to find out the identity of the sources Woodward relied on for his book, Fear: Trump in the White House. The Times essay is sure to throw fuel on an already raging fire.  The president said the anonymous article was \"really a disgrace\", and White House press secretary Sarah Huckabee Sanders sent out a sharply worded official response.\"The individual behind this piece has chosen to deceive, rather than support, the duly elected president of the United States,\" she writes. \"He is not putting country first, but putting himself and his ego ahead of the will of the American people.\"Both Ms Sanders and Mr Trump lashed out against the New York Times for publishing the essay, with the president adding that \"all these phony media outlets will be out of business\" once he leaves the presidency, as they will have nothing left to write about.Outside of the administration, the essay will set off one of Washington's favourite games - guessing the identity of an unknown author. Not since \"Anonymous\" wrote the novel Primary Colors, a thinly disguised fictional account of the 1990 Bill Clinton presidential campaign, has there been a mystery like this.Given that much of the focus of the piece is on conduct in international affairs, the spotlight will probably shine the brightest on the president's foreign policy team - in the Department of State, National Security Council and Department of Defense. There will also surely be calls for this administration official to reveal him/herself. \"The crisis of our time is that people in positions of power see a president who shows 'a preference for autocrats and dictators' and 'anti-democratic impulses', but do not publicly stand against them, and so allow it to continue,\" tweets Congressman Don Beyer of Virginia.An anonymous confession that only confirms the fears of Mr Trump's critics is hardly a profile in courage. Following so quickly on the heels of the Woodward book, however, the New York Times essay will make for a one-two punch that will be difficult to shake off.",

            "content": "Hurricane Lane has been downgraded to a tropical storm as it churns towards Hawaii, but is still causing flash flooding and landslides.Schools and offices were closed as residents took shelter from the storm, which pummelled the US state with strong winds and torrential rain.But Hawaii looks was spared its first direct hit by a major storm in 25 years.President Donald Trump earlier declared a state of emergency for the state. The White House said federal authorities were on standby to provide support and supplies to local and state emergency response efforts. The Central Pacific Hurricane Center said early on Friday afternoon Hurricane Lane was \"weakening quickly\", with sustained winds of 85 mph (137km/h).By 17:00 local time (03:00 GMT Saturday), the sustained wind speed had dropped to 70 mph, although \"more flooding and damaging winds\" were expected on parts of the islands.Weather Service forecaster Leigh Anne Eaton said some parts of Big Island had already seen almost 3ft (90cm) or rain.Meanwhile, the National Weather Service said there had been \"catastrophic flooding\" and wind gusts reaching 67mph (108 kmph).Federal Emergency Management Agency (Fema) chief Brock Long took to Twitter to warn those in Hawaii to \"heed the warnings of local officials and stay aware of your surroundings\" until the danger had passed.Amidst concerns of the approaching storm, emergency personnel responded to \"rapidly spreading\" brush fire in western Maui. The fire has prompted highway closures, power outages and precautionary evacuations.Lane was also forecast to cause dangerous surf heights of up to 25ft (7.6m) in Maui and Oahu. Officials warned of \"significant beach erosion\" and waves hitting coastal roadways.Meanwhile, United Airlines said it had cancelled all Friday flights to and from the main airports on Maui, the second-largest island.Roads were closed due to the landslides and images of cars attempting to tackle the deep waters were posted on social media.HAWAII FLOODING:Flash flooding has already been occurring in parts of Hawaii, especially the Big Island. Rainfall of 5-10” with isolated higher totals have already been observed. Much more rain on the way as #Hurricane #Lane edges closer to the islands. #HIwx pic.twitter.com/BnuA0nHZGiEnd of Twitter post  by @TylerABC57Residents in other areas of the Big Island, such as Hilo, were caught out by the flash floods with several vehicles becoming trapped.A member of staff at a local service station in Haleiwa, on the north shore of Oahu island, told AFP news agency that motorists had been \"constantly filling\" their vehicles. \"Everybody is in a panic mode right now, everyone is filling up gas, gas cans, propane cans,\" he said. According to the Red Cross, more than 1,500 people are in shelters, Hawaii News Now reported.Hawaii Governor David Ige urged residents to set aside supplies of water, food and medicines as a precaution and to avoid driving if possible.Dozens of evacuation centres were also set up throughout the day as Mr Trump urged Hawaiians to hunker down and prepare for the worst. According to NWS, only four named storms have made landfall in Hawaii since 1959 - and only two of those storms were hurricanes.Hawaii generally sees about one storm strong enough to earn a name pass within 60 miles of the islands every four years.Earlier this month, Hurricane Hector, a category four storm, also passed by the islands, though it did not come as close as Lane.The state has also seen serious volcanic eruptions this summer, with lava and ash spewing from the Kilauea volcano on the Big Island since May.Find out how hurricanes form using the guide belowA guide to the world's deadliest stormsHurricanes are violent storms that can bring devastation to coastal areas, threatening lives, homes and businesses.Hurricanes develop from thunderstorms, fuelled by warm, moist air as they cross sub-tropical waters. Warm air rises into the storm.Air swirls in to fill the low pressure in the storm, sucking air in and upwards, reinforcing the low pressure.The storm rotates due to the spin of the earth and energy from the warm ocean increases wind speeds as it builds.When winds reach 119km/h (74mph), it is known as a hurricane - in the Atlantic and Eastern Pacific - or a typhoon in the Western Pacific.\"Everybody has a plan until they get punched in the face.

            "content": "Japan's weather agency has declared a heatwave sweeping the country a natural disaster, with at least 65 deaths recorded in the past week.An agency spokesman warned that \"unprecedented levels of heat\" were being seen in some areas.More than 22,000 people have been taken to hospital with heat stroke, nearly half of them elderly, officials say.On Monday, the city of Kumagaya reported a temperature of 41.1C (106F), the highest ever recorded in Japan.The heatwave shows no sign of abating, forecasters say. In central Tokyo, temperatures over 40C were also registered for the first time.The Japan Meteorological Agency warned that temperatures of 35C or higher would continue until early August.\"We are observing unprecedented levels of heat in some areas,\" spokesman Motoaki Takekawa said, adding that the heatwave was \"a threat to life and we recognise it as a natural disaster\".In Ibaraki prefecture, north of Tokyo, a 91-year-old woman was found collapsed in a field and later pronounced dead in hospital. In nearby Saitama two elderly women were found dead in their homes. With less than half of Japan's public schools equipped with air conditioning, government spokesman Yoshihide Suga said the summer holidays could be extended to protect pupils.\"As a record heatwave continues to blanket the country, urgent measures are required to protect the lives of schoolchildren,\" he told a news conference on Tuesday.The public is being advised to drink plenty of water, to use air conditioning and to rest often.People in some cities have taken part in an event known as uchimizu, or \"water ceremony\" - pouring or sprinkling cold water on to the hot pavements in an attempt to cool them.The heatwave closely followed torrential rain that caused severe flooding and landslides in the west of Japan.",

            "title": "Nationalist vote set to shatter Swedish calm",
            "content": "Sweden has long enjoyed a reputation for moderation and balance, but is its political landscape about to change dramatically with Sunday's election, the tightest race in decades?The anti-immigration Sweden Democrats are on course to become Sweden's second-biggest party, after a campaign that has focused on migration and integration.\"They have the most things that are right for me... they're for Swedes,\" says first-time voter Sandra Sundstrom, 18, as she stops at a party stall in Orebro, central Sweden.Not long ago Sweden had one of the most open, generous approaches to asylum in the world, and an electorate that supported it.But things changed swiftly with the migrant crisis of 2015, when Sweden took in a record 163,000 asylum seekers, proportionately more than Germany.The influx put a strain on housing, healthcare and welfare services. The centre-left government brought back border controls and toughened conditions for asylum and family reunification.In this small, politically divided city in rural central Sweden, canvassers hand out flyers on the cobblestones of the main square, Stortorget.\"Many parties want to take in more people from other lands,\" complains Sandra, who is unemployed. \"But the Swedish people can't have the work they really want.\"Sweden's unemployment rate is 6.8%, level with the EU average, but for foreign-born citizens it is 16.2%.Now all Sweden's traditional parties have hardened their tone to reflect concerns about integration and an increase in shootings, hand grenade attacks and arson attacks on cars in areas with a high proportion of immigrants. But it is the Sweden Democrats (SD) who are predicted to almost double their 2014 share, with opinion polls suggesting they will secure the votes of one in five Swedes.For a nationalist party linked for years to neo-Nazis and other far-right groups it would certainly be a success. It only entered parliament in 2010.Meanwhile, there has been a fall in support for the ruling centre-left Social Democrats and the largest traditional opposition party, the centre-right Moderates.The SD's official line now is that it welcomes supporters from all backgrounds, although racist scandals persist.One municipal candidate shared a song on Facebook with the lyrics \"Swedes are white and the country is ours\", according to a report in tabloid Aftonbladet.\"There are no Nazis in our party,\" says Per Soderlund, the party chairperson in Orebro. \"If you look at our voters and our members, it's basically your average Joe. It's your neighbour.\"The SD core base is working class men. But growing numbers of women and more educated and higher-income voters are also backing their tough line.\"I think many voters feel fed up, they want to give the finger to the big parties,\" says Ola Karlsson, who leads the Moderates in this part of Sweden.\"It's easy to say we should have changed earlier, much earlier,\" he admits. Analysts agree that the big parties were slow to change their stance on immigration, but Orebro University political scientist Ann-Catrin Kristianssen believes they also failed to move the debate away from the \"dark picture\" painted by the Sweden Democrats.After all, Sweden's economy is booming and the state continues to provide a strong welfare safety net.\"There are problems in some of the urban areas and no party is really denying that. But Sweden is a rich country and has a lot to offer its citizens. Why haven't they been able to paint this brighter picture?\" Ms Kristianssen asks.And it has not been all about immigrants, because climate change has become a top issue for voters. Sweden has just had its hottest few months on record, hit by Europe's heatwave.Around 25,000 hectares of forest burned in wildfires and many farmers were forced to destroy livestock after their pasture land dried up. \"It's been a tough summer,\" says Adam Arnesson, 28, who runs a farm just outside Orebro and usually votes for one of Sweden's smaller centre-right parties. \"I'm thinking more about voting for the Greens because they are the only ones putting the climate in the centre.\"Support for the Green party, which had been struggling after various internal scandals, has crept up across Sweden.The Left party is making gains too, both on the environment and from centre-left voters dissatisfied with the mainstream parties' approach to migration.Some analysts think the heatwave could weaken support for the Sweden Democrats, who are popular in rural areas but do not prioritise climate policies. But many voters in Orebro remain undecided. \"I will not vote for (the) Sweden Democrats, that's the only thing I know!\" says Salmon Kidane, 20. And 70-year-old Ruth is unhappy that the Swedish idea of solidarity is losing traction, in a nation traditionally proud of its openness.\"I'm afraid of those populist trends that are coming in Europe. I have a feeling we're going the same way in Sweden and I don't like that,\" she says. Few imagine the SD will get into government, as they are still too far from the traditional parties' agendas to even negotiate a coalition.But Ann-Catrin Kristianssen thinks the nationalists could \"rewrite the political map\" and Sweden's old \"bloc politics\" could well end.",

            "title": "Letter from Africa: Kenya MPs should 'stop telling women what to wear'",
            "content": "In our series of letters from African journalists, Kenya's Joseph Warungu criticises male MPs for complaining about a female colleague's blouse rather than tackling pressing issues like the fuel price hike that has hit the nation. I've got a serious issue with dress. Not on salads, not on furniture, not on wounds - but the kind that we wear to cover our nakedness.And don't get me wrong, I'm actually fully clothed as I write this letter.But even in my Sunday best, I'm not particularly well dressed these days and that's because I'm in a foul mood.I filled my car with fuel the other day and what came out of my wallet was much more than what trickled into my petrol tank, thanks to a new fuel tax.And I'm holding the men and women we elected into parliament a year ago directly responsible for my misery.They knew about the government plan that it would impose a 16% tax on petroleum products, further squeezing the pockets of the ordinary Kenyan who is already gasping for breath caused by the effects of the high cost of living.My car, which is normally loyal and calm, actually threw a tantrum at the petrol station in the form of an overheating radiator, forcing on me the extra expense of coolant to appease the engine. But instead of focusing on the fuel price rise and other pressing matters, the parliamentarians of the male variety cast their eyes on a female lawmaker's appearance.  They argued that the short-sleeved blouse worn by MP Sabina Chege was contrary to the dress code set by parliament.Opposition MP John Mbadi said she had dressed \"inappropriately\" because she had \"exposed her arms\". He was supported by the ruling party's Aden Duale, who said women should wear clothes that are \"modest\".Deputy Speaker Moses Cheboi ended the debate by backing Ms Sabina.\"Members of the press and the National Assembly must be properly dressed; male MPs must wear collared long-sleeved shirts; a tie, a pair of socks and shoes. Women, on the other hand, should wear clothes that are decent, formal, and are of business-wear nature,\" Mr Cheboi said.\"I am looking at Honourable Sabina Chege and, though she has exposed her arms as Mr Mbadi said, she seems to have dressed in a formal and business manner,\" he added.  Kenyans exploded in anger, especially on social media.\"Our parliament is too petty,\" wrote one person. \"How can they discuss Sabina Chege when we've got more important issues to address?\"@ntvkenya @Amina_Kenya our Parliament is too petty. How can they discuss @SABINACHEGE dressing whereas we got more important issues to address? I don't see anything wrong with her dressing. Actually our MPs don't value the Kenyans who voted for them #TTTT #HeyAminaEnd of Twitter post  by @emilymutwiriAnother Kenyan on Twitter directed his astonishment towards the leader of the majority in parliament, the president and his deputy: \"I wish you [would] spend the same vigour and time to discuss fuel prices in Kenya.\"You need to listen in on what our members of Parliament are discussing. I wish you spend the same vigor and time to discuss fuel prices in Kenya. @HonAdenDuale @WilliamsRuto @UKenyatta #PunguzaBeiYaMafuta Sabina Chege's dress code will not help Kenyans.End of Twitter post  by @Sam_MasikasonYet another frustrated citizen described the parliament as a house of chauvinists and asked: \"How can seeing a woman's arms distract you from dealing with important issues eg poverty, illiteracy, lack of important infrastructure etc?\"I was watching a Clip On YouTube on How Sabina Chege & Millie Odhiambo's short sleeved Blouses Caused a Stir! I wonder, How can seeing a Woman's arms distract you from Dealing with important issues eg Poverty, Illiteracy, Lack Of important Infrastructure etc? House of ChauvinistsEnd of Twitter post  by @JamesNjenga03This is not the first time that dress in Kenya has become a national issue. A week ago, women MPs walked into parliament wearing white headscarves. Their startled male counterparts sought the protection of the speaker, saying they felt intimidated. But Speaker Justin Muturi responded: \"I have been informed there is nothing hidden beneath the headgear. I have no objection to it as it will not affect business in the House\".The women MPs said their dress code was a peaceful protest to push for the passing of a rule that would help bridge the gender gap, by ensuring that no single gender should occupy more than two thirds of public positions.A more drastic dress protest happened in the early 1990s during the campaign for multi-party democracy.  Joseph Warungu:I'm contemplating a dress code protest of my own and the sight will not be pretty.A group of mothers whose sons had been detained in a crackdown on pro-democracy activists, launched a protest at Uhuru Park in the heart of the capital, Nairobi. When their daily protests to have their sons freed were met with the heavy hand of a defiant government, the mothers, who included the late Nobel Peace Prize winner Wangari Maathai, turned to a very powerful dress option. They decided to strip naked. In many African cultures, it is a grave matter and often a curse for a mother to strip or expose her breasts in protest. The scene created a national political, cultural and moral crisis in the country.The Kenyan authorities have always had an unhealthy interest in their citizens' dress.Following the attempt by a section of the military to topple President Daniel arap Moi in 1982, the government banned the wearing of clothes that resemble the military without the written approval of the head of the police. So combat fashion is out of fashion in Kenya. But it is the extreme action of parliament to scrutinise whether its female members are dressed modestly that has sparked heavy criticism. It raises the question: what exactly is modest? Taking a cue from parliamentarians, citizens lower down the food chain have in the past become moral police and attacked and publicly stripped women they accuse of being indecently dressed prompting the famous fight back by women, which used the hashtag #MyDressMyChoice.Houses of parliament around the world are sometimes turned into rowdy playgrounds, boxing rings and theatres of misogyny where even harmless Freudian slips can overshadow serious matters of state.In Tanzania's parliament not too long ago, a female MP and former minister was busy explaining a point about how development should become contagious so that \"the more we spread out, the more our neighbours should get ready\".The MP was of course talking about villages but the male parliamentarians' minds immediately went to the gutter and before she could conclude her point the whole house was rocked by laughter. But this is no excuse for our Kenyan MPs to lose focus.If parliament does not get back to what we elected it to do and rather continues to be fixated on what women wear, I'm contemplating a dress code protest of my own, as a way to protect my wallet from the itchy hands of a broke government.And when I do, the sight will not be pretty.More from Joseph Warungu:The handshake that left millions of Kenyans confusedInside the gated communities of WhatsAppBible-bashing for votes in KenyaShould degrees be necessary for leaders?How to stop exam cheatsKenyans beg for mercy",

            "title": "India Andhra Pradesh: What happened to the newest state capital?",
            "content": "India's Prime Minister Narendra Modi laid the foundation stone for a new capital in the southern state of Andhra Pradesh in 2015. But three years later nothing has been built in Amaravati, which was touted as a city that could \"make India proud\", reports Sriram Karri.The state was forced to look for a new capital after it was split in two to create India's 29th state, Telangana. The current capital Hyderabad went to the new state, although both states were to share it for 10 years.The plans for Amaravati were ambitious to say the least. The city was to be developed over 7,500 sq km (2,895 sq miles) over the next 10 years, and it was envisaged it would be 10 times bigger than Singapore.The chief minister of Andhra Pradesh, N Chandrababu Naidu, who was widely held to be responsible for converting Hyderabad from a sleepy historic town into a global software destination during his previous term as chief minister between 1995 to 2004, was brimming with confidence.He had proposed a scheme where farmers voluntarily surrendered their land in exchange for developed land in the city.But today, nothing has been built on the vast amount of land procured from farmers. Even roads and basic infrastructure like drainage and power lines are yet to be put in place. Barring an interim government complex with a Legislative Assembly and a Secretariat, there is nothing.The big reason has been Mr Naidu's personal obsession with grandiose designs and obsessions for historic legacy.First, the government chose Maa Ki, an architects' firm from Japan, to create designs. After a year of changes and upgrades, their designs were rejected; and the project was handed to London-based Foster + Partners, early last year.Thy are known for designs and projects globally, especially prestigious structures like the London headquarters of Swiss Re and the German parliament, but the chief minister remained unimpressed with their models for the Government Administrative Complex. With not even a design for the first of the buildings in three years, Mr Naidu approached filmmaker Rajamouli, whose mythological epic, Bahubali, set in a fantastical city, was a huge hit. He was roped in to go to London and advise the architects on finer design elements. The movie director confessed to his own inability to play a role in designing a city but Mr Naidu's critics say he ploughed on regardless.Having allied with the ruling Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP), Mr Naidu had hoped Mr Modi would fund the Amaravati project besides giving Andhra Pradesh a special category status so that tax concessions would have investors rushing to the state. A few months ago, Mr Naidu withdrew support for the Modi-led government and changed his political position overnight to oppose the BJP at next year's elections. Mr Naidu then approached the World Bank for a loan of 38 billion rupees ($535m; ‎£411m) and India's building authorities for another 75 billion rupees. All borrowing failed to match the huge capital costs needed to even start building the city of his dreams.Meanwhile, the government of India capped its funding for Amaravati at 15 billion rupees, barely adequate for building the governor's house, high court and legislative assembly besides a few other administrative offices.Given the state's poor financial condition, Mr Naidu had no option but to find creative ways to raise funds.One such experiment was a crowd-sourcing effort to raise emotional equity around the city. Dubbed \"My Brick, My Amaravati\", the government asked people worldwide to buy e-bricks at 10 rupees. After several campaigns to promote it, all it had was about 227,000 donors buying 5,708,905 e-bricks.In a first of its kind, the cash-starved state government issued high interest-assured long-term Amaravati bonds on the Bombay Stock Exchange and raised 20 billion rupees. At a grand function, where the bonds were oversubscribed 1.53 times, Mr Naidu announced he planned to raise an additional 100 billion rupees soon. So buoyed up was Mr Naidu by the response by institutional investors to his bonds, that he outlined a grand vision.\"I want to host the Olympics at Amaravati in the near future,\" he said.  But the first master plan created for Amaravati by a Singaporean firm had described the location to build the capital as \"low to medium flood prone\" and suggested a water network mitigation within the proposed city.India's environment body, the National Green Tribunal (NGT), had also accused the state government of not considering \"ecological and environmental aspects of the project\". But it eventually gave a conditional nod to the proposed development.\"Amaravati is an environmentally unsustainable project and a flood risk,\" says Prof Ramachandraiah Chigurupati of the Centre for Economic and Social Studies. \"In a zone characterised as low-lying plains with fertile agricultural land, floods will be a feature. The state has been hit by several cyclones over the years. \"In times of global warming, which leads to intense bursts of heavy rains, an entire city could be inundated within hours, leading to massive destruction as witnessed in the recent cyclones in Kerala.\"Sriram Karri is author of the bestselling, MAN Asian Literary Prize longlisted novel, Autobiography of a mad nation, whose next book will be One Farmer Less.",

            "content": "A pair of ruby slippers worn by Judy Garland in The Wizard of Oz has been found 13 years after being stolen, according to US authorities.They were taken from a Minnesota museum in 2005, when someone broke in through a window late at night.Three others pairs of ruby slippers worn by Garland in the 1939 film are known to exist. An anonymous donor once offered a $1m (£775,000) reward for the stolen pair's whereabouts and the thief's name.However, the reward expired on the tenth anniversary of the robbery. It is unknown if the shoes' recovery is related to any tip-offs.In press conference on Tuesday afternoon, no specific details were given about where they were found or how. FBI special agent Joan Sanborn indicated that the investigation was still ongoing. \"We've gathered lots of information on this case. We believe there's lots more to give,\" she said. The slippers are often said to among the most valued props in movie history. This pair was insured for $1m but experts have said they could be worth two times that now. The Judy Garland Museum in Grand Rapids, Garland's birthplace, had been loaned the slippers from a collector named Michael Shaw.The theft was described as a simple smash-and-grab, with the glass display case destroyed and the slipper snatched.Almost no clues were left behind, neither footprints nor fingerprints, and the surveillance camera was not working that night. \"I literally felt like I was hit in the stomach when I got the call,\" Mr Shaw told Newsweek in 2015. \"My knees buckled, and I went right down on the floor. I had taken care of those shoes for 35 years!\"Jon Miner, the museum's co-founder, told the magazine he was also devastated. \"I cried,\" he said. \"I couldn't believe this happened to us because it was the stupidest thing.\"The museum has kept the podium - labelled \"Dorothy's Ruby Slippers\" - empty since they disappeared. A documentary about the theft - Who Stole The Ruby Slippers? - was released in 2015. ",

            "title": "Will Idlib spell the end of Syria's war?",
            "content": "Syria's north-western province of Idlib is the last major area under rebel control. Over the course of the fighting it has become home to huge numbers of internally displaced people. Around three million are now concentrated in this largely rural region. A series of deals have allowed rebel fighters from other areas to move there too, as the Syrian government has consolidated its hold over large swathes of the country. Now President Bashar al-Assad is turning his attention towards Idlib. His forces and their allies are massing. There has also been a significant Russian naval build-up off the Syrian coast. Many of its vessels carry the sort of land-attack missiles that could add weight to the Syrian government forces' firepower.For the Syrian government an offensive would mark the climax of President Assad's efforts to regain control of his country and to shatter the organised opposition to his rule. But aid agencies and the United Nations fear a major humanitarian catastrophe could be looming. What is at stake is nothing less than the future shape of the Syria that President Assad will control. But this is not just a battle between his government forces and the rebels. Two other countries, Russia and Turkey, are also intimately involved. Frustrated by US policy towards Syria and alarmed at the tide of refugees that had flowed across its own borders, Turkey sought with Russia, Iran and the Syrian government to establish a small number of so-called \"de-escalation zones\".An agreement, aimed to calm the fighting and introducing an element of stability, called for the ending of hostilities between Syrian government and rebel forces in four, mainly opposition-held areas of the country. Russia, Turkey and Iran were to act as guarantors, sending troops and monitors to police the zones.But all but one of these zones have now fallen to government forces. Idlib is the last one remaining. Turkey has armed a number of rebel militias in Syria and has made a significant political and military investment in Idlib. Additionally, it has sought to develop some kind of understanding with the dominant rebel group in the province, Hayat Tahrir al-Sham or HTS (formerly known as Jabhat al-Nusra, which was closely linked to al-Qaeda.) This is, though, a sometimes bumpy relationship. Turkey, as part of its role as guarantor of the Idlib de-escalation zone, has also established about a dozen observation posts in Syrian rebel territory. These have been beefed up and are now essentially small military bases in their own right. The Ankara government has described a major attack on Idlib as a \"red line\" that should not be crossed. Nobody knows quite what Turkey might do if a major regime offensive is unleashed.The strains in the alliance of convenience between the Syrian government and Turkey might also be reflected in tensions between Turkey and Russia. Relations between the two countries have been complex. In November 2015 Turkey shot down a Russian warplane that it said had intruded into its airspace from Syria. But in September 2017 Turkey signed a deal with Russia to arm its forces with Russian S-400 anti-aircraft missiles.Then, in March 2018, units of the Turkish-backed anti-Assad group, the Free Syrian Army, took control of the Syrian Kurdish city of Afrin.But Idlib could also open up difficulties between the Syrian government and Moscow. Russia is the other key overseas player in this drama. It effectively saved President Assad by intervening in the civil war. Russian air power along with Iranian-backed militias and military advisers on the ground enabled him first to stabilise his worsening situation and then to go onto the offensive. But what does Russia think of the Idlib situation? On the face of it Russian spokesmen appear to be against a major attack, preferring a negotiated settlement for the province. Russia is eager to scale down its military role in Syria, though its naval build-up in the eastern Mediterranean might suggest otherwise. But, as ever in Syria, things are even more complex. Russia may be unable to dissuade its Syrian ally from an Idlib offensive. A government assault could amount to a number of different things. These could range from an all-out onslaught to a more restricted effort to nibble away key pieces of territory, to increase pressure on the rebels in those areas that remain. Russia retains its enthusiasm for combating \"terrorists\" wherever they may be, and there is no doubt that some of the hardcore elements of the rebels have been forced into Idlib province following setbacks elsewhere.The humanitarian consequences of any Idlib offensive would be serious. There are fears, too, that chemical weapons might again be used to terrorise the local population into submission. But the fall of Idlib would not be the end of Syria's nightmare.The Assad regime's hold over much of the country could remain shaky, with significant areas staying beyond central control. The tasks of reconstruction and resettlement are huge and costly: problems with which nobody seems ready to engage.What began as a local uprising against an unpopular regime has mutated into a regional struggle. It has drawn in proxies for organisations like al-Qaeda and the Islamic State group. But above all Syria has become a cockpit for wider international tensions, with Russia, Turkey, Iran, Israel, the Gulf states and the US all seeking their own advantage. These external pressures will not go away after an Assad victory. They may even get worse. The US, Israel, and Washington's Gulf allies are now all intent on seeing Syria as yet another battlefront in the strategic struggle against Iran.",

            "title": "Iraq Yazidis: The 'forgotten' people of an unforgettable story",
            "content": "In the ancestral land of the Yazidis, a sacred mountain looms large. A persecuted people has long seen it as their protector.\"Sinjar mountain saved me, and many other Yazidis, four years ago,\" says Hade Shingaly as we sit on thin mattresses covered with bright geometric patterns in his family's elongated tent. It is perched in a tidy cluster of tarpaulin shacks on a mountain plateau in this remote corner of Iraq.  Through a window of plastic sheeting, we can see Sinjar's rocky brown slopes speckled with scruffy green shrubs. Hade's family fled their village in 2014 to take refuge here, along with tens of thousands of other Yazidis fearing for their lives, when fighters of the Islamic State (IS) group swept with shocking cruelty across vast stretches of Iraq and neighbouring Syria. Four years on, Hade's family, and many others, still live on these slopes, even though the extremist group no longer controls this area.  They are terrified IS will return.\"We don't trust our neighbours,\" he tells me as we sip traditional cinnamon tea and sample fresh figs. \"When IS came to our village, they didn't know anything about the Yazidis.  Our Muslim neighbours told them 'the Yazidis don't believe in God, that we aren't Muslim'.\"IS killed the men, and sold women into slavery in markets in Iraq and Syria,\" he recalls bitterly. A rooster's crow pierces the late afternoon quiet, and an old generator to provide electricity clatters into action -  a far cry from homes they had proudly built in their village. In 2014, heart-rending images of Yazidis struggling to survive on this forbidding massif alerted the world to their desperate plight. It helped push the United States to join the military campaign against IS extremist rule. Western helicopters dropped food and water on Sinjar mountain amid alarming reports Yazidis were dying of dehydration and hunger. Crumpled clothes discarded in panic by people on the run still litter the mountainside - chilling mementos of a painful past.Now the Yazidis feel they have been abandoned by the world.The main town of Sinjar, at the foothills of the mountain, still lies in utter ruin. Bombs and booby traps laid by IS are still strewn in the rubble. One date  - 3 August 2014 - is daubed on some walls still standing. For a people who feel forgotten, it is impossible for them to forget all that has happened to them since IS smashed into their lives.   \"I still have flashbacks and sometimes faint 30 times a day,\" explains Bahar Dawood in a quiet monotone voice as her three young children huddle next to her.  A short time later, she falls to the ground. Like nearly 7,000 other Yazidi women, Bahar was enslaved and brutalised by IS fighters - and some 3,000 women and children are still believed to be enslaved by IS. Her children show the scars of violent beatings inflicted on them.\"This child sometimes cries for two hours asking for her father and brother,\" she says as her daughter, Ramzya, wraps her small arms around her mother's neck to hold her even closer.  \"We haven't heard anything from them in two years.\"With no men to provide for them in this traditional society, the 33-year-old mother and her children found refuge in an orphanage set up by a local Yazidi family, with some assistance from a German aid agency. Hundreds of thousands of Yazidis now live in displacement camps scattered across Iraq's northern Kurdistan region. Tents and containers sit in long neat lanes, flanked by newly planted trees, and tiny patios - efforts of a proud people to try to ease their hardship. \"Yazidis feel betrayed by their neighbours, forgotten by their government, and the provision of aid is dwindling,\" says Kris Phelps of the British charity War Child, one of the few international non-governmental organisations (NGOs) still working in Yazidi camps. \"It's really striking to see the surge and ebb in attention the Yazidis have received,\" Ms Phelps remarks.Disputes between the Kurdish administration in northern Iraq and the central government in Baghdad have also complicated relief efforts and security arrangements in a region which includes Kurds and Arabs.\"What's your dream?\" I ask a Yazidi teacher playing games with children in one of the few spaces to help displace painful memories with positive moments.\"We need more aid agencies to come here and help us, \" he replies, without a pause. \"If they don't come here, the world needs to help all of us to leave.\"This ancient sect, one of the world's oldest monotheistic religions, has survived for centuries by living apart in a tight-knit community.  There are less than a million Yazidis worldwide, and most are in this Iraqi heartland. Now they see their fate inextricably linked to the wider world. Yazidis speak of surviving 74 genocides throughout their tormented history the horrific IS campaign to eradicate their faith and culture, recognised by the United Nations as genocide, may have dealt the most brutal blow. At one of the largest Yazidi temples, which escaped the wrath of IS, the priest invokes a long list of Western countries by name when he catches sight of a rare group of foreign journalists.  \"All humane countries of the world must see our situation,\" Sheikh Ismael Bahri intones loudly as worshippers encircle a pillar of flickering candles in the temple's inner sanctum. \"We've not harmed anyone. All we want is help and protection.\" The Yazidis' plight has moved some countries, including Australia, Canada and Germany, to offer refuge to a limited number of Yazidi victims, with a particular focus on women brutally enslaved by IS. A makeshift visa application centre on the top floor of an Iraqi hotel is packed. Some people, including elderly grandparents and toddlers, step nervously into the lift - something they've never used before. Three, sometimes four, generations sit around tables to document their family's history to consular officials and NGO volunteers tasked with taking all their details. Every family who makes it to this centre has gone through some preliminary vetting but across the Yazidi heartland, everyone has a story of suffering.  \"We feel threatened here, we don't have a future here,\" insists Tuli Bahri Evo, whose family crossed the border from Syria where the Yazidis' presence is also dwindling. Alarmed by a potential exodus which could endanger the very survival of this tiny community, Yazidi leaders are begging the world to help them stay here. \"We need our own Yazidi force so we can protect ourselves,\" the Yazidis' religious leader, Baba Sheikh, tells us in a hushed tone as the white-robed wizened old man receives Yazidi well-wishers at his home. \"The world is only talking about Yazidis but doing nothing.\" Others call for Western militaries to send forces - an option unlikely to be accepted by the Iraqi authorities, even if it was considered in Western capitals.Yazidis fear IS fighters are still hiding in plain sight and will one day return. \"They've just shaved their beards and changed their clothes,\" Hade insists as we walk through the settlement on Sinjar mountain where some tents are fashioned from the same tarpaulin dropped by Western helicopters four years ago. \"Nothing has changed. Why doesn't someone do something?\" Hade asks, knowing there is no simple or easy answer. ",

            "title": "Bob Woodward's book on Trump: The most explosive quotes",
            "content": "A Bob Woodward expose book has been a rite of passage for presidential administrations since the storied investigative reporter first made a name for himself by breaking Richard Nixon's Watergate scandal. Now it's Donald Trump's turn under the microscope.The picture revealed - of an administration having a \"nervous breakdown of executive power\" - is unflattering in the extreme.Donald Trump's supporters will say, not without cause, that Woodward epitomises the Washington establishment their man is fighting against.It's also true, however, that the reporter has unrivalled access to the corridors of power, and the general Washington consensus is it's better to talk to him than not, since your colleagues - and enemies - are certainly giving him their side of the story. While the accounts in Fear: Trump in the White House are provided on \"deep background\", the episodes Woodward recounts and the quotes he attributes come from those in the room - and often, in fact, from the people who were doing the speaking.The White House, and the president himself, have since responded to the book, calling it \"fabricated stories\" by \"former disgruntled employees\".\"It's just another bad book,\" Mr Trump told the Daily Caller during an interview, adding that Woodward \"has a a lot of credibility problems\".Here's a look at some of the blockbuster revelations that have emerged so far from early excerpts of Woodward's book.Woodward describes several instances where Trump administration officials - chief economic adviser Gary Cohn and White House Staff Secretary Rob Porter, in particular - removed documents from the president's desk to keep Mr Trump from signing them.It was all part of a larger effort to insulate the administration, and the nation, from what they saw as Mr Trump's more dangerous impulses. Documents that would have allowed the president to withdraw the nation from the North American Free Trade Agreement and a trade deal with South Korea were hidden - and the US has since committed to renegotiating the pacts. Woodward describes these acts as \"no less than an administrative coup d'etat\".On 27 January, according to Woodward, the president's personal attorney John Dowd staged a mock interview session with the president to demonstrate what he feared would be the disastrous results if Mr Trump were to sit down with Robert Mueller's special counsel team investigating possible ties between the Trump campaign and Russia.It didn't go well, as the president grew increasingly frustrated with the intensity of the questioning, at one point angrily calling the investigation \"a goddamn hoax\".Dowd would go on to meet with Mr Mueller and reportedly tell him that he couldn't agree to the interview because he didn't want to let the president \"look like an idiot\" and embarrass the nation on the world stage.When it later appeared that the president had changed his mind and was going to testify after all, Dowd resigned. One of the sources of considerable consternation for the president's staff, per Woodward, was what they viewed as his dangerous impulses on foreign policy.After the US believed the Syrian government had launched another chemical attack in April 2017, Mr Trump told Defence Secretary James Mattis to assassinate President Bashar Assad.\"Let's kill the [expletive] lot of them,\" the president reportedly said.Mr Mattis acknowledged Mr Trump's request then, after the conversation, told an aide he wouldn't do \"any of that\".Woodward says administration officials were also concerned when the president asked for plans for a pre-emptive military strike on North Korea during the height of his feud with Kim Jong-un. The president also dressed down top generals over their handling of the war in Afghanistan, saying that soldiers \"on the ground\" could do a better job.\"How many more deaths?\" he asked. \"How many more lost limbs? How much longer are we going to be there?\"Woodward paints a picture of a White House staff constantly beaten down and belittled by a temperamental president. When White House economic adviser Cohn tried to resign after the president offered sympathetic comments about white nationalists who engaged in a violent August 2017 rally in Charlottesville, Mr Trump accused him of \"treason\". Cohn, according to Woodward, views the president as a \"professional liar\".Mr Trump also told Commerce Secretary Wilbur Ross he didn't trust him. \"I don't want you doing any more negotiations,\" the president reportedly said. \"You're past your prime.\"He compared his first chief of staff, Reince Priebus, to a rat. \"He just scurries around.\"As for Attorney General Jeff Sessions, who the president has publicly berated, privately he was even more disparaging.\"This guy is mentally retarded,\" Mr Trump reportedly told staff secretary Porter. \"He's this dumb Southerner. He couldn't even be a one-person country lawyer down in Alabama\".If the president was abusive toward his staff, it appears they have got some measure of revenge in the Woodward book, which is chock full of caustic quotes about the president attributed to the aides and advisers who serve him.Chief of Staff Kelly repeatedly calls Mr Trump an \"idiot\" and said that \"it's pointless to try to convince him of anything\". Defence Secretary Mattis told an aide that the president has the foreign policy understanding of a \"fifth- or sixth-grader\" (an 11 or 12-year-old).Mr Kelly's predecessor, Reince Priebus, describes the presidential bedroom suite as \"the devil's workshop\", where Mr Trump fires off intemperate tweets early in the morning and on weekends.Mr Trump's relationship with Rex Tillerson reportedly never recovered after news accounts that the former secretary of state once called the president \"an [expletive] moron\". If that's the case, Woodward's book could cause serious damage within the White House in the coming days.In a pre-emptive strike against what is sure to be a furious White House pushback against the book, the Washington Post released an audio recording and transcript of a call the president made to Woodward in early August. In it, the president claims he was never contacted for an interview or informed of Woodward's soon-to-be-published work - an assertion the reporter successfully rebuts.Mr Trump makes several attempts to steer conversation toward his foreign policy achievements and economic record as president.\"Nobody's ever done a better job than I'm doing as president,\" he says. \"That I can tell you.\"Woodward says through his interviews he \"gained a lot of insight and documentation\" - and that his book would be a \"tough look at the world and your administration and you.\"\"I assume that means it's going to be a negative book,\" the president replies.Woodward concludes the call by saying \"I believe in our country, and because you're our president, I wish you good luck\".If his book is any indication, Woodward probably thinks Mr Trump will need all the luck he can get.",

            "content": "The authorities in Saudi Arabia have arrested more than 20 clerics and intellectuals in an apparent crackdown on dissent, activists say.Prominent Islamist clerics Salman al-Odah and Awad al-Qarni are among those reportedly detained since the weekend.There has so far been no confirmation from the authorities.But on Tuesday, state media said a group of people acting on behalf of \"foreign parties against the security of the kingdom\" were being held.The individuals were not identified, but a security source told Reuters news agency they was accused of \"espionage activities and having contacts with external entities, including the Muslim Brotherhood\".  The Brotherhood, an Islamist movement designated a terrorist organisation by Saudi Arabia, is central to a dispute between the kingdom and neighbouring Qatar.Saudi Arabia, the United Arab Emirates, Bahrain and Egypt severed all links with Qatar in June, accusing it of supporting regional terrorist groups.Qatar acknowledges that it has provided assistance to the Brotherhood, but denies aiding jihadists linked to al-Qaeda or so-called Islamic State (IS).UK-based human rights activist Yahya al-Assiri told the Wall Street Journal the officers who took Mr Odah into custody in Riyadh on Saturday night had cited his failure to express his support for Saudi policy on Qatar as a reason for his arrest.On Friday, Mr Odah had expressed hope on Twitter that a telephone conversation between Saudi Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman and Qatari Emir Sheikh Tamim bin Hamad Al Thani signalled an end to the dispute. However, Saudi officials subsequently announced that they were suspending all dialogue with Qatar, accusing it of \"distorting facts\" in a statement about the conversation.Mr Odah, who was once known for his extreme religious views and was imprisoned from 1994 to 1999 for agitating for political change, is a popular cleric with 14 million followers on Twitter.Mr Qarni, who was detained in the southern city of Abha, had reportedly called for better relations with Qatar on his Twitter account, which has two million followers.On Wednesday, activists circulated a list of other figures they believed had been detained, including several other clerics, academics, television presenters and a poet. Some had no clear links to Islamism or obvious history of opposition to the Saudi monarchy.The Saudi interior ministry meanwhile urged citizens to report any comments on social media promoting \"terrorist or extremist ideas\" via a phone app launched last year. The public prosecutor reminded them separately on Twitter that \"harming the state's reputation or status\" constituted a \"terrorist crime\". The apparent crackdown also comes after an opposition group calling itself the \"15 September Movement\" issued a call for peaceful protests this Friday to press the authorities to tackle poverty, increase women's rights and release political prisoners. Protests are banned in Saudi Arabia.",

            "content": "A South Carolina woman has been charged with murder after allegedly poisoning her husband by putting eyedrops into his water for several days.Lana Clayton, 52, was arrested weeks after her husband, Stephen Clayton, 64, was found dead at home. She was detained when a toxicology test discovered a chemical called tetrahydrozoline in his body.The substance is found in over-the-counter eyedrops and nasal sprays that are available without a prescription. On Friday, York County police also charged her with unlawful malicious tampering of food between the dates of 19 and 21 July, when the alleged murder occurred.In a statement, police say she admitted to poisoning her husband \"without his knowledge\".She was arrested and held in custody on Friday. Police have not announced any potential motive.Mr Clayton, who founded a physical therapy company, was pronounced dead after appearing to suffer a fall down stairs in the foyer of his home in the upmarket neighbourhood of Clover - about 20 miles from Charlotte, North Carolina.A funeral was held for him in the couple's backyard in early August - friends and neighbours say - before investigators discovered his cause of death.According to the Herald newspaper, Mrs Clayton has no previous criminal record, and has not been arrested before.Prosecutors say they are now reviewing a 2016 incident, in which she shot her husband in the head with a crossbow as he slept.Police determined that that shooting was \"accidental\", according to a police report obtained by the Charlotte Observer.Investigators found Mrs Clayton at home \"crying and upset\" after the crossbow incident, according to the report.She said at the time that her husband was mentally abusive to her, and had \"mood swings\" but never physically hurt her.Tetrahydrozoline can cause seizures, stop breathing and induce comas, according to the US National Library of Medicine.Even a few drops of the drug, which is intended to reduce redness, can cause \"serious adverse events\".The couple had been together for eight years, friends told WSOC-TV. Others added that she was known to attend the neighbourhood Bible study group.Mr Clayton's family told the station that they were \"shocked and mortified at the cause of Steven's death\".\"All of our family and friends know how much he loved his wife, Lana, and how devoted he was to her. We are all still trying to process this.\"According to the York County Probate Court, Mrs Clayton was appointed to represent Mr Clayton estate after his death.Mrs Clayton's Facebook page states that she worked for the US Department of Veterans Affairs in Charlotte.Their home, worth about $800,000 (£620,000), was modelled on the Mount Vernon estate of the first US President, George Washington.",

            "content": "Farmers across eastern Australia are enduring what some have called the worst drought in living memory. On Wednesday, the entire state of New South Wales (NSW) was declared to be drought-affected. It is the same situation in more than half of neighbouring Queensland.Many farmers say they are struggling just to keep going, with little rain forecast for the coming months.\"Farmers are getting out left, right and centre. It's gotten to the point where it's cheaper to shoot your cows than it is to feed them,\" NSW dairy farmer Jason Maloney told the BBC.\"No-one likes doing that. You've bred them from birth - they've been part of your life. But it gets to a point of no return.\"Farmer Ashley Gamble says his family has been part of Queensland's dairy industry for more than 150 years. He fears that five-generation legacy will end with this drought.Mr Gamble says his 850 cows typically produce at least five million litres of milk each year. Due to the drought, production has halved.His farm is running at a loss, and he can no longer afford to feed the cows.Sourcing hay is a challenge, and paying for it is even harder. Mr Gamble says a single truckload costs A$4000 (£2,300; $3,000), and supplies last less than a day.\"I don't know where we're supposed to get the feed from to keep going,\" he says. \"We're living day by day and this drought could go on for another six, 12 months. \"It's just so depressing. I get up at 02.30am and finish at 19:00. It's 365 days a year. It never stops.\"Lynette Rideout-Kenneally owns an orchard just outside of Sydney, in NSW. Amid the drought, the two dams her property relies on have nearly dried up. Ms Rideout-Kenneally says she has some water in reserve, in case bushfires break out in summer.But she says: \"In terms of usable water for the farm, we're out.\"\"We're relying on donations of water every few weeks and it's scarcely enough to keep things going,\" she tells the BBC.\"I am extremely concerned. My focus has changed from looking into spring and summer with a good harvest, to just trying to keep my trees alive.\"She says that most of her apple and peach trees will not yield any fruit fit for sale this year. About three quarters of the trees she planted last spring have died. Ms Rideout-Kenneally says the conditions are the worst she has experienced.\"We are not getting any seasonal storms - any top up of soil moisture whatsoever,\" she says. \"It's so dry. The water's just being sucked out like a sponge.\"Jade Whatman, 22, says she sees the strain of the drought in her parents' faces.Like other dairy farmers, they are struggling to make ends meet. Their last purchase of hay cost A$19,000 - a load they hope to stretch out over a week.\"Mum was so stressed - she broke down and was crying before,\" Ms Whatman says.\"They are constantly worried about how we'll buy the next load of hay, and the cows not being able to produce as much milk.\"She says she worries about her parents: \"I will call Dad and think of some question to ask, just to hear that he is ok.\" The family recently set up an online fundraising page, which has raised more than A$40,000.\"People are caring, and we have gotten support from the community and that has helped us stay positive,\" she said.\"Farmers are resilient people and we'll get through this.\"",

            "title": "Libya violence: UN says ceasefire agreed",
            "content": "The United Nations says the rival militia factions that have been fighting in Libya's capital Tripoli for the past week have agreed a ceasefire. At least 47 people have been killed and 1,800 families internally displaced by the violence, officials say.Last week, a ceasefire deal announced by officials from western cities only held for a few hours.A UN-backed government is nominally in power in the capital, but militias occupy much of the rest of the country.\"Under the auspices of [UN envoy Ghassan Salame], a ceasefire agreement was reached and signed today to end all hostilities, protect civilians, safeguard public and private property,\" the Unsmil mission said.The ceasefire also provides for the reopening of the capital's only functioning airport, Mitiga, which has been closed since 31 August due to the clashes. The agreement \"does not aim to fix all the Libyan capital's security problems; it seeks to agree on a broader framework on the way to start addressing these issues,\" the mission said. The talks included military officers, leaders of various armed groups in and around the capital and the UN-backed Government of National Accord (GNA). This is the third attempt to end the outbreak of violence in Tripoli as the first two ceasefires were broken almost immediately. This time there's a signed agreement mediated by the United Nations. By Rana Jawad, BBC North Africa correspondentIf the ceasefire holds, it will be a short-term fix because the underlying issues that drive these bouts of deadly militia violence in Tripoli are rooted in governance, and institutional issues that could take years to overcome.  For the international community, containing this deadly conflict was a priority because it threatened the standing of the only government  they can deal with and what has been a painstakingly slow return of foreign missions and diplomats to Tripoli since 2014. But this ceasefire only buys them time. Every government that has come and gone, whether backed by the international community or not, has legitimised these competing armed groups on and off, including all those involved in the fighting this past week. This allowed them to grow more powerful and richer over the years, and for the rivalry to deepen and boil over as it did this month. As it stands, the authorities need some of them to remain in power because they have not figured out how to do without them.  If they can maintain the peace long enough, it may give the UN and member-states a chance to take control of further mediation and new parallel efforts that start finding solutions to the root causes of Libya's troubles.The armed group that sparked the eight-day conflict posted a statement saying its commander supported the truce; the group claims the agreement includes the departure of its rivals from Tripoli.  Those rivals are militia brigades which are nominally attached to the interior ministry in the Tripoli government.  The violence has forced thousands of people to flee to nearby towns or seek shelter in other parts of the capital, while many more have remained trapped inside their homes.The violence broke out last week when militias from a city to the south of Tripoli attacked its southern areas, leading to fighting with local militias that support the GNA.Hundreds of migrants trapped by the fighting have been moved to other detention centres.Libya has faced continuing chaos since Nato-backed forces overthrew long-serving ruler Col Muammar Gaddafi in October 2011.

            "title": "Sweden Democrats tap into immigration fears as vote looms",
            "content": "Their logo is a blue-and-yellow flower - the colours of the Swedish flag - and politically the nationalist Sweden Democrats (SD) are in full bloom.After entering the parliament with 5.7% of the vote in 2010 they went from strength to strength. Opinion polls suggest they are heading for second place in the 9 September election. They currently have 42 of the 349 seats in parliament.The SD has capitalised on widespread insecurity in Sweden about immigration. During Europe's 2015 migrant crisis Sweden took in a record 163,000 asylum seekers, many of them Muslims from war-torn Syria and Iraq. It was the highest such intake in the EU, per head of population.Ten years ago migration was a minor issue in Swedish politics; now it is one of the top issues.The party opposes multiculturalism, the liberal mixing of cultures that Sweden's mainstream parties have espoused for years. Sweden has long been seen as a beacon of tolerance because of that liberal consensus. The SD accuses the traditional centrist parties of \"wrecking\" social welfare by encouraging the arrival of foreigners - especially Muslims - who they argue do not share Swedish values. Yet Muslims make up only about 1.5% of the Swedish population.\"Most of the immigrants haven't had a chance to become part of Swedish society and of course many of them have been Muslims and many segregate in suburbs around the big cities and build parallel societies,\" SD leader Jimmie Akesson told the BBC.The SD manifesto says \"we want to stop receiving asylum seekers in Sweden and instead go for real aid for refugees\". \"We want to enable more immigrants to return to their native countries.\"Shootings have risen in Sweden - something the SD links to the rise in immigration, although official figures show no correlation. Much attention has focused on Malmo's troubled, mainly immigrant Rosengard district.It was founded in 1988, with the goal of defending Swedish values and cutting immigration.It has neo-Nazi roots - the founder members belonged to white supremacist groups. But to win votes in liberal Sweden the party had to shed those racist connections and become more mainstream. Enter Jimmie Akesson, who became leader in 2005 and pursued zero tolerance towards racism in the party. Several members were expelled.He led an SD youth branch when he was still at school. Now 39, he hails from Soelvesborg, a small southern town, and studied political science before entering local politics.\"There are still some neo-Nazis in the party,\" said Anders Sannerstedt, a political scientist at Lund University in southern Sweden.\"Akesson said people who in their teens had Nazi links should be forgiven and should be open about it. They still have a lot to do, but they've been more careful this time vetting candidates for election, nationally and locally,\" he told the BBC.Mr Sannerstedt says Mr Akesson's drive to broaden the SD's appeal has worked and, like some other rising nationalist parties in Europe, it has a populist agenda setting it apart from the political \"establishment\".The SD is very active on the internet, knowing that many of its supporters \"don't trust traditional media that much, so they are looking at social media instead\", Mr Sannerstedt says. Politically it is closer to the nationalist Danish People's Party than to the far-right Alternative for Germany (AfD), he says. In the European Parliament the SD is in the same Eurosceptic group as the UK Independence Party (UKIP).The SD is strong on issues that especially vex poorer sections of society: not just immigration, but also healthcare, law and order and pensions. Across Europe many voters accuse established parties of neglecting those issues.The anti-euro SD also wants a \"Swexit\" referendum - to give Swedes the choice of leaving the EU. But the powerful centrist parties all oppose such a vote. \"The SD won't join a government, it's out of the question,\" according to Mr Sannerstedt. \"The other parties don't want to co-operate with them.\"Coalitions with the SD may be possible, however, on some local councils.The SD's rise has put the immigration issue centre-stage in Sweden and even in opposition it can heavily influence policy.Patiently Mr Akesson has strengthened the party organisation, making it a big force to be reckoned with.

Anyone producing or distributing such material could face up to five years in prison and an $800,000 (£623,000) fine.Prosecutors have in the past used the Gulf kingdom's anti-cybercrime law to prosecute critics of the government.But the latest announcement emphasises that satire can now also get social media users in serious trouble.In the past year, the Saudi authorities carried out an apparent crackdown on dissent that has reportedly seen dozens of women's rights activists, human rights defenders, influential Islamist clerics and intellectuals detained.The most prominent cleric to have been arrested is Salman al-Odah, who has more than 14 million followers on Twitter.On Tuesday, Saudi activists and Mr Odah's family reported that prosecutors were seeking the death penalty at his trial at a terrorism tribunal in Riyadh.The 61-year-old - who was arrested last September after posting a tweet endorsing warmer relations with Qatar - is accused of \"seeking to spread sedition\" and \"incitement against the rulers\", according to London-based rights group ALQST.Mr Odah's son, Abdullah, said he faced 37 charges in total, including establishing an organisation for defending the Prophet Muhammad and tweeting against \"tyranny\".Reports that Saudi prosecutors are seeking the death penalty against prominent Saudi cleric Salman al-Awda. Bringing the death penalty into a case like this is a major escalation in the level of repression. https://t.co/f7dokH0Ep4End of Twitter post  by @coogleaThere was no immediate confirmation from the authorities, but the pro-government newspaper Okaz and other Saudi media also reported on the case.Adam Coogle of Human Rights Watch tweeted that \"bringing the death penalty into a case like this is a major escalation in the level of repression\". Prosecutors are also said to have sought the death penalty for five activists, including the female rights defender Israa al-Ghomgham, on trial for participating in anti-government protests by the minority Shia Muslim community in Qatif.",

Mr al-Abadi then sent troops to push back Kurdish forces in the north, in an effort to halt the Regional Government's plans to negotiate an independent Kurdistan.

Farm owner May McKeown said she had not seen much rain since 2010.About 98% of New South Wales is drought-stricken, and two-thirds of neighbouring Queensland. As a result, farmers are having to order in food for their livestock, which raises their costs considerably.A cow walks away from a water tank in Tamworth, New South Wales. \"I cant seem to be able to do anything else apart from just feed, and keep things going,\" farmer Tom Wollaston said. \"[The drought] seems to be one step ahead of me all the time.\"A dried-up dam near Gunnedah in New South Wales.

Government aid includes funding towards better mental health services for struggling farmers.Parts of Australia saw the second warmest summer on record between December and February, and the country as a whole saw its driest July since 2002.An irrigated paddock next to one that has not been watered.

            "title": "The challenge of 'farming the desert' in Australia",
            "content": "The plight of drought-hit farmers in Australia has prompted an outpouring of sympathy across a country that has long mythologised the inhospitable \"bush\" and its inhabitants. But it has also raised questions about subsidising those eking a living in agriculturally marginal areas, writes Kathy Marks in Sydney.Mellissa Conomos runs beef cattle on a 300-acre property in Gunnedah, in north-western New South Wales. This year, her dams are dry and her paddocks are bare. \"They're living on dirt,\" she says. \"Even the weeds are gone. You've got sheep walking away from newborn lambs because they know they've got no chance of raising them.\"Gunnedah has been hard hit by the prolonged dry weather crippling eastern Australia, which is being compared to the \"Millennium Drought\" that scorched the country during the 2000s.Ms Conomos is hand-feeding her animals expensive trucked-in hay. She has had to sell half her black Angus herd, along with 30 sheep. \"Some people are feeding orange peel to their cattle, that's how desperate it's getting.\" With little or no rain in recent months, the whole of NSW has been declared in drought, together with 60% of Queensland. Images of caked paddocks and starving animals have horrified Australians, and the new Prime Minister, Scott Morrison, has named drought relief as the nation's \"most urgent and pressing need right now\".In recent weeks, the federal government has announced extra household assistance for farmers, bringing the total aid bill to A$1.8bn (£1bn; $1.3bn).The poet Dorothea Mackellar called Australia \"a sunburnt country, a land … of droughts and flooding rains\". Seventy per cent of the mainland is classed as arid or semi-arid, meaning it receives less than 500mm of rain annually. Just over half of Australia is used for agricultural production. However, even in good years when the rain buckets down, crop yields are significantly lower than elsewhere.Resourceful and innovative, most farmers make a reasonable living, maximising their returns in good times and planning for drought by putting aside cash, storing fodder and destocking. Others, less efficient or battling more rugged conditions - attempting to \"farm the desert\" as some critics say - struggle, but mostly hang on. Many are reluctant to leave farms that may have been in their families for generations. \"The reality is that the Australian climate is extremely variable, with extended periods of drought,\" says John Daley, chief executive of the Grattan Institute, a think tank. \"The current conditions are not extraordinary. So if you're not surviving a drought, which is in many ways very predictable, you have to ask why.\"Many farmers say this drought has been their worst. But Mr Daley contends that farmers - who receive transport subsidies and low-interest loans, among other government assistance - should be treated no differently from other business owners.\"The fundamental question here is: what's so special about farming? We've seen car manufacturing and other industries go to the wall in Australia on the basis of economic rationalist arguments. What we wind up doing is bailing out those farmers who are least able to cope.\"Lately, the agricultural skills of Aboriginal Australians have been highlighted by indigenous historians such as Bruce Pascoe, who in his 2014 book Dark Emu detailed how, pre-colonisation, the country's first inhabitants grew crops and conserved soil, water, wildlife and fish.The land was then degraded by Europeans' hoofed livestock and intensive farming techniques, he wrote.Today, Australian agriculture is worth more than A$63 billion (2016-17), with more than three-quarters of output exported. Outsiders are often astonished to learn that the nation's agricultural products include water-thirsty cotton and rice. Many farmers rely on irrigation, and there is a thriving water market.Linda Botterill, a professor of public policy at the University of Canberra, says farming is \"part of our national identity\", with public affection for farmers common \"right across demographics and voting intentions\".That affection is clear from the countless \"sausage sizzles\" and other fundraising events being held in communities across Australia. One supermarket chain, Coles, matched customers' drought aid donations, dollar for dollar, during August.Mr Morrison's predecessor, Malcolm Turnbull, defended additional public funds for drought relief as aimed at relieving household poverty rather than propping up failing businesses. \"It is designed to keep body and soul together, not designed to pay for fodder,\" he said. However, Peter Harris, chairman of the Productivity Commission, the federal government's main economic advisory body, told the Sydney Morning Herald last week that decades of drought assistance totalling billions of dollars had done little to help farmers, and similar measures, if taken now, were \"condemned to fail\".The challenges facing farmers are set to become more acute, with climate change bringing more frequent and severe droughts, altering rainfall patterns and making more land agriculturally marginal or unviable, say scientists.The opposition Labor Party's agriculture spokesman, Joel Fitzgibbon, has warned Mr Morrison that he will \"fail farmers\" unless he acknowledges climate change as a factor in the current drought and commits to \"both mitigation and adaptation\".In order to meet future challenges, farmers need better data on weather, soil and drought-resistant crops, according to Prof Barry Pogson, a plant biologist at the Australian National University. He is researching ways of manipulating genetic \"switches\" to send plants into survival mode quickly, then restore them to growth mode quickly when drought subsides, making them more productive.John Freebairn, an economics professor at the University of Melbourne, believes farmers should decide where and how they farm. \"If they think they can push the margins out a bit further, with new technology or whatever, and are able to make a go of it, that's fine,\" he says. \"But we shouldn't be subsidising them.\" The current dry is worse even than the Millennium Drought, says Mellissa Conomos. \"I've never seen the whole district so dry,\" she says, adding that suicide is a major issue in rural communities.\"Farming is always a gamble, but at the moment we're living day to day, just praying and hoping for rain. And it still hasn't come.\"",

            "content": "The suggestion by a pair of Belgian teachers to drop a rule of grammar drilled into every French speaker at an early age has led to some amusement and consternation in France.The teachers say rules for past participles that follow the verb avoir (to have) should be simplified.The change would save some 80 hours of teaching time, they argue.It has been endorsed by the linguistic authorities of Belgium's French-speaking Wallonia region and Brussels.Currently, the rule is that the past participle of a verb does not agree with the direct object of a sentence if it comes after it, but it does when the object comes before the participle. So for instance, in the sentence j'ai mangé des frites (I ate chips), mangé remains the same. But in the sentence les frites que j'ai mangées (the chips that I have eaten), the participle agrees with the word chips, which is feminine and plural.The two teachers, Arnaud Hoedt et Jérôme Piron, argue the rule is overly complicated and inconsistent, and that the participle should remain unchanged regardless of the position of the object in the sentence if used with the verb to have. \"Schoolchildren ask, why before and not after?\" they said in an opinion piece in Liberation (in French).The rule was imported from Italy by pedants in the 16th Century and is being dropped in everyday use, the pair argue. The suggestion led to anger and derision on social media, with some arguing the change would amount to ignoring the subtleties of the language.One teacher and grammar expert said the change was akin to \"wanting to raze all the little streets in an old city\".Vouloir supprimer toutes les subtilités d'une langue, c'est un peu comme  vouloir raser toutes les petites rues d'une vieille ville.@Le_Figaro @ClaireConruyt @AliciaDeveley @ArnaudHoedt @jerome_piron#orthographe https://t.co/jzy9WAexRJEnd of Twitter post  by @OChartrainAnother user says if the rule is dropped, why not also drop the offside rule in football?

            "content": "A section of highway connecting Sydney and Melbourne started to melt. Bats fell dead from the trees, struck down by the heat.On the northern Great Barrier Reef, 99% of baby green sea turtles, a species whose sex is determined by temperature, were found to be female.In outer suburban Sydney, the heat hit 47.3C (117F) before a cool change knocked it down - to the relative cool of just 43.6C in a neighbouring suburb the following day.Scenes from a sci-fi novel depicting a scorched future? No, just the first days of 2018 in Australia, where summer is in fierce form.With parts of the US suffering through a particularly grim winter, extremes in both hemispheres have triggered discussions about the links between current events and the build-up of carbon dioxide in the atmosphere.The climate system is incredibly complex and no weather event can be directly attributed to rising emissions, but everything that is experienced today happens in a world that is about one degree warmer than the long-term mean. Prof Andy Pitman, the director of the ARC Centre of Excellence for Climate Extremes at the University of New South Wales, says given the average temperature has risen it is a \"no brainer\" that the likelihood of the sort of heat that hit Sydney last week has also increased.\"It was a meteorological anomaly, but the probability works a bit like if you stand at sea level and throw a ball in the air, and then gradually make your way up a mountain and throw the ball in the air again,\" he says.\"The chances of the ball going higher increases dramatically. That's what we're doing with temperature.\"While it is record-breaking that tends to make news, scientists say it is the unbroken run of hot days in the high 30s and 40s that causes the significant problems for human health, and other life.Health officials in Victoria highlighted the threat of heatwaves when they found about 374 more people died during an extreme three-day period in January 2009 than would have been expected had it been cooler. There has, however, been relatively little investment in research into the health impact of escalating maximum temperatures.A paper published in the journal Nature Climate Change last year said while a government report called for greater focus on the area 25 years ago, less than 0.1% of health funding since has been dedicated to the impact of climate change.Prof Pitman says Australia is yet to properly consider the health risks of a warming planet.\"It's not being able to cool down at night, and in the days that follow, that causes problems,\" he says. \"I was camping in the Blue Mountains [west of Sydney] on Saturday night. It was about 30 degrees at midnight, and I could feel my heart racing. Now, that extra stress on my cardiovascular system didn't kill me, but it might have if I was 20 years older.\"Police are warning motorists to expect delays and to avoid the right-hand lane of the Hume Freeway (heading toward the city) near Broadford as there is a 10km stretch of road that is melting. pic.twitter.com/icI1hecmvnEnd of Twitter post  by @VictoriaPoliceLast year was Australia's third-warmest year since records began, according to the Australian Bureau of Meteorology.Globally, it was the second or third warmest, and comfortably the hottest year in which there was not an El Niño weather system helping push up temperatures further. Put another way: it is now hotter without an El Niño than it was with an El Niño just a few years ago.In eastern Australia - where the bulk of the population lives - temperatures were particularly inflated during summer months, when an increase is most likely to lead to uncomfortable or dangerous heat.Several locations had runs of record hot days and nights. More than 40% of the most populous state, New South Wales, recorded at least 50 days hotter than 35C. The town of Moree had 54 consecutive days of extreme heat.\"Across Australia, the last five years were all in the top seven years on record. That's quite a striking signal,\" the Australian Bureau of Meteorology's Dr Blair Trewin says.The extra energy warming up the climate system is also being felt in several ways. The bushfires season starts earlier than it used to, and Australia has already experienced wild blazes this season.Along with the increased background heat, this is in part due to a clear drying pattern in some areas. Rainfall is down for both the south-east and south-west of the country in the cooler months months between April and October.\"That also has quite significant impacts for agriculture because historically that's when they get most of their inflows,\" Dr Trewin says.The impact of warming on the World Heritage-listed Great Barrier Reef, the only living structure visible from space, has been well documented. Estimates suggest about half its shallow-water coral was killed during bleaching events over the past two years linked to increased water temperatures.Further south, the sea along Tasmania's east coast has warmed dramatically, pushing tropical species to unlikely high latitudes and coinciding with the disappearance of giant kelp forests.Some weather patterns have not changed. There is no evidence of variations in cyclone behaviour or the frequency or intensity of large hail and lightning, for instance.All this comes against a backdrop of political fighting over how to tackle climate change.It is less than a year since senior government members brandished a piece of coal in parliament to taunt the Labor opposition, whom ministers accused of wanting to see an end to the fossil fuel industry.The Malcolm Turnbull-led government remains committed to a 2030 target pledged at the Paris climate talks: a 26-to-28% cut below 2005 emissions. It says it can cut emissions while shielding the public and business from unnecessary price rises. It also points out that Australia is directly responsible for little more than 1% of global emissions (though it is responsible for about 30% of the global coal trade).But national greenhouse accounts released in the week before Christmas showed Australia's industrial emissions have been on an upward curve since 2014, when the government repealed carbon pricing laws, which required big business to pay for its pollution. Emissions had fallen in the two years the laws were in place. The latest projections in the accounts suggest Australia will overshoot its 2030 target unless new policies are introduced to arrest the growth.\"There really isn't an argument that climate change isn't true in parliament anymore,\" Prof Pitman says. \"You'd find a couple of members of parliament that say that, but you'd also find a couple who didn't believe in evolution and didn't believe in inoculating children against disease.\"The issue now is that the scale of concern - and the action under way or committed to both in Australia and internationally - doesn't match the scale of the problem.\"",

            "content": "Donald Trump's former chief strategist, Steve Bannon, has been disinvited from the New Yorker Festival after a high-profile backlash over his appearance.Since leaving the White House, Mr Bannon has continued to champion right-wing political causes.On Monday he had been announced as an honorary guest at the magazine's 19th annual literary event in October. A number of attendees, including actor Jim Carrey and presenter Jimmy Fallon, then said they would not attend.Comedian and producer Judd Apatow said he would be withdrawing from the event because he could not take part in any event \"that normalises hate\".Bannon? And me? On the same program?Could never happen.End of Twitter post  by @JimCarreyChelsea Clinton, daughter of Bill and Hillary, described inviting Mr Bannon as the \"normalisation of bigotry\".For anyone who wonders what normalization of bigotry looks like, please look no further than Steve Bannon being invited by both @TheEconomist & @NewYorker to their respective events in #NYC a few weeks apart. https://t.co/u0TDfCYrQ1End of Twitter post  by @ChelseaClintonDirector Ava DuVernay and author Roxane Gay also spoke out against the decision. Following the backlash, the New Yorker's editor-in-chief released a lengthy statement where he explained why he had initially asked Mr Bannon to the New York festival, and then withdrawn the invitation.\"To interview Bannon is not to endorse him,\" David Remnick said. \"By conducting an interview with one of Trumpism's leading creators and organizers, we are hardly pulling him out of obscurity.\"Ahead of the mid-term elections and with 2020 in sight, we'd be taking the opportunity to question someone who helped assemble Trumpism.\"He then said concern from others about the setting of the interview, which he was due to conduct on-stage, had made him change his mind. \"I don't want well-meaning readers and staff members to think that I've ignored their concerns,\" wrote Remnick.He said he would consider interviewing him instead in a \"traditionally more journalistic\" setting in the future.Mr Bannon hit out at Remnick for backtracking after \"seven weeks of continuous requests\" to get him to accept the invite.\"In what I would call a defining moment David Remnick showed he was gutless when confronted by the howling online mob,\" Mr Bannon said. Before his role with the Trump campaign, Mr Bannon helped found Breitbart News - a right-wing US online news and commentary website. He left the White House in August 2017 but has continued to vocally support right-wing political causes around the world, including championing a Europe-wide populist \"supergroup\".He is still set for an appearance at The Economist's Open Future festival, also in New York, later this month.

            "title": "Flowerboys and the appeal of 'soft masculinity' in South Korea",
            "content": "A man wearing make-up on the street may elicit unwelcome glares, questions about his masculinity and even his sexuality. But in South Korea, ideas about how to look good as a man are changing attitudes and influencing the world, as the BBC's Saira Asher reports. When the BBC posted a video about the make-up routine of a 16-year-old YouTuber in Seoul on Facebook, the reactions ranged from intrigued to downright vitriolic.Some assumed this meant he was gay, while others admonished him for his choice saying \"real men don't wear make-up\". There were, of course, those that argued for his freedom to live life however he pleased and against the \"fragile masculinities\" on show.But Kim Seung-hwan is used to it. He says he's been called gay by some Koreans online for as long as he's been doing make-up tutorials.When asked about whether he thought he looked feminine after he put on make-up, he was confused by the question as if he had never even thought about it.\"No I don't. I do not think about this being a girly look,\" he says. \"It's about looking good.\"For those uncomfortable with men who wear make-up, the scene at a high-end salon for men in Seoul's Gangnam district would have been quite something. But it points to an important shift in cultural expectations.Senior make-up artist Han Hyun-jae expertly applies foundation, eyeliner and lipstick on a man. He chooses from an array of products and brands that will be familiar to most women, and goes in for the final touches of what he calls the K-pop (short for Korean pop) look . It's a scene that repeats itself day after day.Packs of confident young men saunter into the salon and then leave with perfect skin and hair. Many of them are singers or actors on their way to promotional events. One man is there for his wedding make-up, a common practice for men in South Korea. He chooses to get red lips for his special day.\"We make their complexion cleaner, eyebrows darker, contour their faces and draw out their masculinity in a way they can't do themselves,\" says Mr Han. He says men come in wanting to look like their favourite K-pop idols. In the last few years, K-pop bands and Korean dramas have become the major influence on young people in the country and last year K-pop broke into the mainstream US and UK music scenes.\"I think Korea is a trailblazer in men's beauty culture, definitely in Asia at the moment, if not the world,\" says Joanna Elfving-Hwang from the University of Western Australia, who has done extensive research on beauty and image in South Korea. \"The way they (K-pop stars) play with masculinity, what it means to be a beautiful man in a heterosexual or non-heterosexual way, it opens up possibilities for men on the street and eventually makes it more acceptable.\"This doesn't mean every man in Seoul walks around with a full face of make-up. But in young and fashionable neighbourhoods like Myeung-dong it's common to see men walking around with foundation or BB cream (blemish balm) - a moisturiser and light foundation hybrid.More importantly it has allowed for a much looser interpretation of what's acceptable for men when it comes to beauty.And some young Korean men are unapologetic about the drive to enhance their look.That wasn't always the case. In the 1980s and 90s the salaryman was the prevailing male aesthetic. Suits, luxury watches and a traditional strong male look were the norm. Korea has mandatory national service and that moulded and defined what men thought would look appealing.\"In the 80s and 90s, men in Korean pop content were largely portrayed as tough guys in gangster and detective films, and rebellious young men in some TV dramas,\" says Sun Jung, the author of Korean Masculinities and Transcultural Consumption.But all that changed in the mid-1990s when music group Seo Taeji and The Boys came onto the scene, says Prof Elfving-Hwang. They used rap, rock and techno influences and incorporated English language into their music.They kick-started fan culture which has now become a major force in the music industry, she says.Then followed the big entertainment companies churning out K-pop girl bands and boy bands, and their influence has been like nothing before it.\"Compared to the 80s and 90s, now there are a lot more soft masculinities - pretty boy images and gentle male images - represented in media, and consumers welcome and widely consume them,\" says Dr Sun Jung.They came to be known as Khonminam - combining the words for flower and a beautiful man. She says it takes inspiration from similar concepts in Japan of bishonen or beautiful boys and Shojo manga - girls comics.But it's not feminine.\"I think the phenomenon should rather be explained through the notion of hybrid or versatile masculinity - soft yet manly at the same time - which is different from effeminised,\" says Dr Jung.She cites Song Joong-ki, the star of hugely popular Korean drama \"Descendants of the Sun\" as the embodiment of this. He may be a khonminam in his look, but as a special forces captain in the military he is also a tough guy.Descendants of the Sun and other Korean dramas have helped spread the South Korean look around Asia and now the world. And that means the ways to achieve that look are in demand. Male idols are plastered on billboards in Seoul hawking products like face masks and moisturisers. Companies are actively hiring men to sell women make-up products. Their fandom in places like China, Thailand and Singapore is not to be dismissed either. Huge crowds show up to their performances and product launches.\"Men in China and South East Asia tend to think that Korean men are the typical beauty,\" says Lee Gung-min, a consultant to South Korean beauty companies. \"That is having a huge impact on male consumers in Asia.\"Beyond Asia, brand Korea is starting to sell well in the US and Europe.Walmart and Sephora now have K-beauty (Korean beauty) brands on their shelves and beauty bloggers are spouting the virtues of the 10-step K-beauty routine for glowing skin. American and European make-up enthusiasts are fast becoming acquainted with brands that were previously only popular in Asia like TonyMoly, Innisfree and Etude House. Most interestingly, established beauty brands are making their own versions of products that originated in South Korea - like Clinique, Lancome and L'oreal introducing cushion compacts.The drive for the perfect face has undoubtedly also contributed to a well reported rise in cosmetic surgeries in South Korea to achieve the desired jawline or nose. But it also stems from a deeply ingrained preoccupation with how you present yourself to others.That's a common sentiment across Seoul. People here really care about how they look and how they come off to the world - both men and women.You can't walk a few steps without coming across a cosmetics or skincare shop with a salesperson outside trying to lure you in with a free face mask, and companies are definitely capitalising on that self-care culture to sell products.But men are now as much at the receiving end of that drive - or perhaps pressure - for self enhancement that women have felt for generations.

            "content": "Politicians have long been associated - fairly or unfairly - with a certain alcohol-related activity in a brewery.But breweries in the Republic of Ireland are raising a glass to their government over a new law.The Intoxicating Liquor (Breweries and Distilleries) Act 2018, enables craft breweries and distilleries to sell alcohol on their premises.It means tourists being shown how beer and spirits are made can then buy them at the end of the tour.There are craft breweries in every county in Ireland, whiskey distilleries in 22 counties and gin distilleries in 14.Some larger breweries and distilleries had previously got round the ban by purchasing a publican's licence and selling their products in bars on the premises.However, that was an expensive option, too much for the dozens of smaller companies operating their own craft breweries or distilleries.The new law also now enables companies to sell their drinks to members of the public to take away between the hours of 10:00 and 19:00.The Irish government says that while the law will increase tourist numbers, it will also create demand for other services, such as accommodation, catering and transport. Justice Minister Charlie Flanagan said that those who have completed tours \"may wish to purchase some of the intoxicating liquor products being produced\".\"This act will facilitate the sale of intoxicating liquor produced on the premises to such tourists and visitors.\"He added: \"We have seen a marked increase in the number of craft breweries and distilleries in recent years, and this trend is set to continue. \"This is a dynamic and entrepreneurial sector with real growth potential. \"It goes without saying that this government is fully committed to promoting regional and local development and, in that context, to fully supporting the job-creation potential of artisan food production and local tourism initiatives.\"  Patricia Callan, director of the Alcohol Beverage Federation of Ireland (ABFI) said they were delighted to see \"this important piece of legislation finally coming into force\". She added: \"We've actively campaigned for reform on how breweries and distilleries can interact and attract tourists. \"This act will greatly benefit new entrants to market and significantly enhance Ireland's tourism offering.\"According to the ABFI, last year 2,590,215 people visited brewery and distillery tourist attractions in Ireland, up from 2,437,206 in 2016. \"This figure is expected to increase again, as visitor centres have reported a strong summer to date for 2018. There is also a number of planned new visitor centres set to open in 2018 and beyond,\" Ms Callan said. \"For example, there are 13 whiskey distillery visitor centres in the planning or development stage at the moment.\"",

            "content": "The European Commission has denied allegations of cronyism after a protégé of its president, Jean-Claude Juncker, was given one of the most powerful jobs in the EU civil service.Martin Selmayr has been appointed Secretary-General of the Commission, the organisation that monitors whether countries are sticking to EU rules, dreams up new laws and runs the Brexit talks day-to-day.Normal service in the Brussels bubble temporarily came to a halt when journalists became consumed by the saga.The 40-something former lawyer and media executive from Germany joined the European Commission as a press officer in 2004.He helped run Jean-Claude Juncker's successful campaign to be selected as president of the commission in 2014 and later became his head of cabinet, Brussels-speak for chief of staff.He has earned multiple nicknames, like the Monster or the Beast of the Berlaymont, the name of the building where he works.It depends who you ask.Admirers, like his mentor the German MEP Elmar Brok, describe a hard-working strategic genius with political nous, who gets much better results than your average official.Detractors say his take-no-prisoners attitude goes too far. Asked about his fierce reputation, Mr Selmayr himself said: \"You can't run the European Commission like a Montessori school,\" referring to the education system that favours child development over passing exams.Brussels-based journalists love to talk about him. Endlessly.Selmayr-slanging has reached new heights. At a surprise press conference in February, Jean-Claude Juncker announced he had been keeping a secret: the commission's top civil servant, the secretary-general, was retiring. Martin Selmayr would take his place.It emerged that Mr Selmayr had applied for the role of deputy secretary-general, got that job and was then instantly promoted.But there's more.It has been suggested that the only other candidate in the race to become deputy withdrew their application, meaning Mr Selmayr had a clear run to the top. It has been alleged that members of the European Commission were offered more generous severance packages as inducements to smooth Mr Selmayr's path, which is vigorously denied.It is claimed that he even plans to knock down walls in the commission's management suite to cement his power.The European Commission's spokespeople have endured hours of questioning about the promotion. And I mean hours.Many of the stories are \"post-truth\", they claim. Especially the one about commissioners' retirement pay-offs.And they say the recruitment process was followed \"religiously\" which prompted a social-media meme of Mr Selmayr dressed as a nun (I told you journalists were obsessed).The European Parliament holding a debate about it on Monday. A motion calls for a formal inquiry into the appointment and more transparency in the recruitment process in general.\"The way Martin Selmayr was appointed puts the European institutions into disrespect. If this procedure was corresponding to the rules, the rules have to be changed,\" said Green MEP Sven Giegold.To MEPs outside the most powerful parliamentary groups it looks like jobs for the boys.To campaigning reporters it smells bad. To less zealous journalists it is great gossip.To Brexiteers it is a \"coup\" that proves the EU's structures are opaque and undemocratic.To me, it is the latest twist in a long-running tussle over where power lies in Europe: with the member states or with an increasingly political commission that seeks to protect the very idea of the EU.",

            "content": "The EU ombudsman has given a damning verdict on the way Jean-Claude Juncker's chief of staff was given the top post in the bloc's civil service.The promotion of Martin Selmayr, nicknamed \"the monster\" by his boss, was fast-tracked in February, in a move condemned by one Euro MP as a \"coup\".Ombudsman Emily O'Reilly identified four counts of maladministration by the European Commission.She said the affair had damaged public trust in EU institutions.Ms O'Reilly agreed with the European Parliament's assessment that the promotion had \"stretched and possibly even overstretched the limits of the law\".However, her report will not affect his promotion. She calls only for the top job to have an appointment procedure separate from that for other senior posts.A lawyer originally from the German city of Bonn, he has worked for the Commission since 2004, but really came to the fore in 2014 when he was picked by Mr Juncker, then the new president of the European Commission, as his chief of staff.He masterminded Mr Juncker's campaign for the presidency, and has since been described as the most powerful man in Brussels and the \"Frank Underwood\" of the Commission, in a reference to the House of Cards political thriller.  In 2017, there were reports that he had leaked details of a confidential Brexit dinner meeting between Theresa May and Mr Juncker. German newspaper FAZ said Mr Juncker had left \"ten times more sceptical than before\".Mr Selmayr has been in charge of the 32,000-strong EU bureaucracy since 1 March. One widely-circulated joke in Brussels about his alleged self-importance runs: \"What's the difference between God and Selmayr? God knows he's not Selmayr.\" It all happened in the space of a dizzying few minutes at a meeting of European commissioners on 21 February.Mr Selmayr was appointed deputy secretary-general and the existing top civil servant, Alexander Italianer, suddenly announced he was retiring. Without being promoted to the deputy's post first, Mr Selmayr could not have been given the top job. The only other candidate for deputy had conveniently pulled out the day before.Mr Juncker then said his chief of staff should get the top job and he was duly appointed.The European Parliament condemned the handling of the promotion, and there were reports that Mr Juncker had threatened to quit if the newly appointed secretary-general was forced out.In her scathing report, Emily O'Reilly pointed to several \"issues of concern\":She cited four instances of maladministration, including failing to avoid risking a conflict of interests, and warned that the sequence of events had placed the \"wider legitimacy of the EU... at unnecessary risk\".The European Commission said it did not share all aspects of the report, but welcomed her decision not to contest the legality of the appointment.",

The Syrian Observatory said the Russian air strikes were the first for 22 days and came hours after three pro-government fighters were killed by rebel rocketfire in the Jabal Turkmen area of Latakia.Syrian army soldiers and allied militiamen have been gearing up for what has been described as a phased offensive on Idlib, the rebels' last remaining stronghold. President Bashar al-Assad of Syria must not recklessly attack Idlib Province. The Russians and Iranians would be making a grave humanitarian mistake to take part in this potential human tragedy. Hundreds of thousands of people could be killed. Don’t let that happen!End of Twitter post  by @realDonaldTrumpHTS, which is designated by the UN as a terrorist organisation and has an estimated 10,000 fighters in Idlib, and rival rebel factions backed by neighbouring Turkey have said they will fight back.On Monday night, Mr Trump warned Russia and Iran, which has sent military advisers and thousands of militiamen to Syria, that they \"would be making a grave humanitarian mistake to take part in this potential human tragedy\".On Tuesday, Mr Peskov questioned the US president's approach to solving the problem of HTS and other jihadists operating in Idlib.\"To just make some warnings, not taking into account a very dangerous negative potential of the whole situation in Syria, is probably an incomplete, not all-encompassing approach,\" he was quoted as saying by Interfax news agency.The Kremlin spokesman said situation in Idlib would be on the top of the agenda at a summit of the presidents of Russia, Iran and Turkey in Iran on Friday.UN special envoy Staffan de Mistura has warned of a \"perfect storm\" if the government goes ahead with a full-scale offensive.The jihadists must be defeated but not at the expense of thousands of civilian lives, Mr de Mistura told reporters last week.He called for further talks on a political solution, or for humanitarian corridors to be set up to allow civilians to be evacuated temporarily to a safer area, most likely one under government control.The UN says Idlib is home to some 2.9 million people, including a million children. More than half of the civilians have already been displaced at least once from elsewhere in Syria and have nowhere left to go.UN officials say as many as 800,000 people could be displaced and that the already high number of people in need of aid could increase dramatically.\"A worst-case scenario in Idlib will overwhelm capacities and has the potential to create a humanitarian emergency at a scale not yet seen through this crisis,\" John Ging of the Office for the Co-ordination of Humanitarian Affairs warned.",

            "content": "Spain has attracted arguably the three brightest lights of world football, with Cristiano Ronaldo of Real Madrid and Barcelona's Lionel Messi and Neymar all plying their skills in La Liga.Over the past year, football fans have become used to seeing the trio caught up in accusations of tax fraud and other financial crimes by the Spanish courts.  And they are not the only players in the crosshairs of the Spanish judiciary. In 2016, Lionel Messi's Argentina and Barcelona team-mate, Javier Mascherano, received a one-year suspended prison sentence for tax fraud.Lionel Messi and father Jorge were last year convicted of defrauding the Spanish state of €4.1m (£3.6m; $4.6m) in unpaid taxes on the striker's image rights, controlled by offshore companies in Belize and Uruguay. The pair were both handed 21-month jail terms in a ruling recently confirmed by Spain's supreme court. Now the original Barcelona trial court must decide whether the sentences should be suspended in accordance with Spanish custom for first-time offenders whose prison terms do not exceed two years.Prosecutors have asked for a two-year sentence and a €10m fine for Neymar, who was cleared of fraud but ordered to stand trial over alleged corruption in his 2013 move from Brazilian club Santos to Barcelona. Now Ronaldo has become the third and final member of the elite La Liga trio to face criminal accusations, after prosecutors announced they were pursuing the 32-year-old former Manchester United man on four counts of tax fraud. A source close to Ronaldo told the BBC that \"he's very sad and really upset\" about the allegations. \"He doesn't want to stay in Spain. At this moment, he wants to leave,\" the source said.Soon after David Beckham joined Real Madrid in 2003, he was able to enjoy a new tax-exemption scheme aimed at attracting foreign talent to Spain across all sectors. That scheme became known as the Beckham Law, when he became one of the first players to sign up to a six-year-long tax ceiling of 24%, roughly half what Spaniards paid on six-figure-plus incomes.Spain was in the midst of an unprecedented economic boom, a perfect playground for \"galacticos\" of the likes  of Zinedine Zidane and Luis Figo, before the arrival of Cristiano Ronaldo and the emergence of Barcelona prodigy Lionel Messi.But in 2010 the Beckham Law was scrapped for salaries of more than €600,000, and since then tax inspectors have begun to wise up to the use of complex financial operations using offshore shell companies to get around  tax laws.\"The line between avoidance and evasion is very fine in these cases. In the past few years Spain's tax agency has intensified its control over footballers and their companies, checking to see if they are mere fronts or whether they are really active economically,\" explains Carlos Cruzado, president of tax inspectors' union Gestha. Neymar is the odd one out. His case involves alleged wrongdoing towards a contractual party regarding his transfer fee, but the forward has been found guilty in his native Brazil for tax fraud on money earned while playing for Santos. $93mCristiano Ronaldo: $58m salary, $35m endorsements$80m Lionel Messi: $53m salary, $27m endorsements $37m Neymar: $15m salary, $22m endorsements The Messi and Ronaldo cases are similar. Both are accused of avoiding tax on sale of image rights by using offshore companies. However, the Portuguese was registered as a non-resident taxpayer under the Beckham Law, while the Argentine has spent his entire adult life registered in Spain. Prosecutors accuse the Real Madrid star of evading tax of €14.7m between 2011 and 2014 via an alleged shell company called Tollin Associates, registered in the British Virgin Islands. Spanish investigators say the company, owned by Ronaldo, is a \"screen\" and has no economic activity apart from having bought and then ceded the player's image rights to a firm based in Ireland that \"genuinely manages [his] rights sales\".  Prosecutors also claim that money earned from image rights was incorrectly described as capital gains, to benefit from a lower tax rate.Lionel Messi was informed by the judge in his case it was no defence to plead ignorance and argue that his father was the only person who knew how his money was being managed.Neymar has denied any wrongdoing and told the court investigating his case that his father and associates dealt with off-field business matters.Cristiano Ronaldo's representatives and legal team say the only dispute can be about quantity and that there has been no intention to commit fraud. \"There is no tax evasion scheme... There has never been any hiding nor any intention to hide anything,\" they say.They argue he has paid tax to the Spanish treasury on 20% of his total image rights when, in fact, more than 90% of these are generated outside Spain as he is such a global name. \"The tax agency clearly thinks that if he is being paid for wearing certain boots, shirts or caps in Spain, then he cannot claim this money is being earned abroad,\" explains Mr Cruzado.Neymar and Lionel Messi look set to be spared prison due to Spain's unwritten two-year-sentence rule, even if Neymar is eventually found guilty. Cristiano Ronaldo may be a different matter. Three of the four accusations of tax fraud are considered by prosecutors to be \"aggravated\", so they carry a minimum sentence of two years each. Four guilty verdicts and he could face as many as seven years. However, an investigating judge needs to ratify the prosecutors' accusations, and that could take many months or even years.  Even if the investigating magistrate does take up the case, the Portuguese will have several options and a guilty verdict would not necessarily mean jail.He could admit guilt, pay taxes and fines in advance and reduce any eventual jail term to a half or quarter of the statutory minimum. That way he would slip under the standard two-year bar for first-time offenders and see his sentence suspended. ",

I’m grateful for all the people who donated to help me get through transplant. I’m grateful for the doctors that’ll be scooping out these lungs and giving me some more life to work with. Im grateful for the chance to keep being a person. I’m grateful for my own head and for all the weird things in it. I’m just really overwhelmingly grateful for all of this.

I'm not an innocent and I'm not a child,\" she wrote in March. The way sick people are captured in media completely ruined any ounce of self confidence i had growing up. I learned to deeply hate having my picture taken by professionals because there was always a need to make me look childlike and innocent- lacking in anything sexual or appealing. I was convinced I looked like an ugly sickly five year old for the first two years of high school and that that was why guys never seemed to be interested in me in “that” way. It took having a fair amount of relationships and casual sex before I realized that I wasn’t the empty smiling shell of a girl I saw reflected back in pictures. It’s so much easier to believe that sick people are cherubs- held in perpetual youth and innocence- who simply don’t understand the truth of their condition because they are living up in the clouds. Seeing people who are sick as anything more complex and intelligent than that would mean we couldn’t use them as these false beacons of hope. I’ve struggled more with guys, depression drugs, family and career than I ever have with my illness. I’m not an innocent and I’m not a child. I’m not “dying before I have had a chance to live” and what I choose to talk about with the world is not just empty positive falsehoods.

Slovenia was the first former Yugoslav republic to join the European Union, in May 2004 - shortly after joining Nato.Unlike Croatia or Bosnia-Herzegovina, Slovenia's independence from Yugoslavia was almost bloodless. The country also found the transition from a state economy to the free market easier than most.Long regarded as one of the best-performing new EU members, Slovenia was dragged into a deep recession by the European financial crisis in 2012.Read more country profiles - Profiles by BBC MonitoringPopulation 2 million Area 20,273 sq km (7,827 sq miles) Major language Slovene Major religion Christianity Life expectancy 76 years (men), 84 years (women) Currency euro President: Borut PahorThe prime minister of a centre-left government between 2008-12, Borut Pahor was was first elected president in December 2012.He won re-election in November 2017.The role of president is largely ceremonial, but carries authority in defence and foreign affairs.Prime minister (outgoing): Miro CerarMiro Cerar was appointed prime minister in August 2014, after month-long coalition negotiations in the aftermath of parliamentary elections.In March 2018 he announced his resignation, after the Supreme Court annulled a referendum backing a major railway investment project. He said tension with coalition partners and trade unions were also making his position untenable. Elections in June saw big wins for the SDS anti-immigration party of veteran former prime minister Janez Jansa, as well as for the relatively new centre-left LMS party. Mr Cerar's liberal SMC lost heavily.Slovenia's media scene is diverse and free. The main papers are privately-owned.The broadcasting sector is a mix of public and private ownership. Many households are connected to cable, satellite, or internet protocol TV (IPTV). There is an advanced digital terrestrial TV (DTT) network.By the end of 2015 almost 73% of the population was online.Some key dates in Slovenia's history:1918 - After the collapse of the Austro-Hungarian empire, Slovenia joins the Kingdom of Serbs, Croats and Slovenes. The kingdom later becomes known as Yugoslavia.1941 - Slovenia is occupied by Nazi Germany and Italy during the Second World War.1945 - At the end of the war, Slovenia becomes a constituent republic of socialist Yugoslavia.1991 - Slovenia, along with Croatia, declares its independence. The Yugoslav federal army intervenes. Slovene forces defend the country. About 100 people killed. The EU brokers a ceasefire.

            "title": "How Venezuela's crisis developed and drove out millions of people",
            "content": "Venezuela's economy is in freefall. Hyperinflation, power cuts, and food and medicine shortages are driving millions of Venezuelans out of the country. Many are blaming President Nicolás Maduro and his government for the dire state the nation is in. Here, BBC News takes a closer look at how Venezuela's economy descended into its current crisis.Arguably the biggest problem facing Venezuelans in their day-to-day lives is hyperinflation. The annual inflation rate reached 83,000% in July, according to a recent study by the opposition-controlled National Assembly.Prices have been doubling every 26 days on average. This has resulted in many Venezuelans struggling to afford basic items such as food and toiletries. With small items like a cup of coffee costing a whopping 2.5m bolivars until recently, it also became increasingly difficult to pay for goods in cash.Until the currency's redenomination on 20 August, Venezuelans needed 25 of their highest denomination notes - the 100,000 bolivar bill - to pay for their caffeine fix. To avoid going shopping with rucksacks full of cash, Venezuelans increasingly started using electronic transfers for even the smallest transactions. As the BBC's South American correspondent found in Caracas, waiters handed customers their bank details trusting that the latter would transfer them the tip electronically.On the most basic level, there are more people wanting to purchase goods than the number of goods available.Venezuela is rich in oil, and has the largest proven reserves in the world. But arguably it's this exact wealth that underpins many of its economic problems.Because it has so much oil, Venezuela has never bothered to produce much else. It sells oil to other countries, and with the dollars it earns, imports the goods Venezuelans want and need from abroad.Its oil revenues account for about 95% of its export earnings. But when the oil price plummeted in 2014, Venezuela was faced with a shortfall of foreign currency. This in turn made it difficult to import goods at the same level as before, and imported items became scarcer.The result: businesses increased prices and inflation rose.Add to that the government's willingness to print extra money and regularly hike the minimum wage in an effort to regain popularity with Venezuela's poor, and you get money which loses its worth rapidly.The government is also increasingly struggling to get credit after it defaulted on some of its government bonds. With creditors less likely to take the risk of investing in Venezuela, the government has again taken to printing more money, further undermining its value and stoking inflation. The government lopped five zeros off the old \"strong bolivar\" currency on 20 August and gave it a new name - the \"sovereign bolivar\".It also began circulating eight new banknotes worth 2, 5, 10, 20, 50, 100, 200 and 500 sovereign bolivars and two new coins. The new currency is part of an \"economic package\" of measures which the government says is the \"magic formula\" to help Venezuela's battered economy recover. Among the measures are:Many people have been voting with their feet and leaving Venezuela. According to United Nations figures, 2.3 million Venezuelans have left the country since 2014 when the economic crisis started to bite.The majority have crossed into neighbouring Colombia, from where some move on to Ecuador, Peru and Chile. Others have gone south to Brazil. Venezuela has also seen more than 200,000 of its citizens emigrate to Spain. Many of them are the children of Spaniards who came to Venezuela in the 1950s and 60s, when it was seen as a place of opportunity.The mass migration is one of the largest forced displacement in the western hemisphere.Read: Bridge of desperation - Exodus from VenezuelaWhile the new currency is likely to make cash transactions easier for a while, its introduction caused confusion. Some Venezuelans managed to get hold of the new bills, but others reported long queues when banks opened.Some economists have also warned that the new currency could soon face the same problems as the old one unless the root causes of hyperinflation are tackled.They say that within months its worth could be decimated by rising prices. Employers have also said that they do not know how they will pay for the 34-fold rise in the minimum wage.Meanwhile, shoppers still face empty shelves in supermarkets, and in some cities there have been water shortages and power cuts caused by a lack of investment in Venezuela's crumbling infrastructure. But while the power cuts and lack of running water are a problem for households and businesses, they have proven deadly in Venezuela's already run-down public hospitals. Many of those fleeing the country say they are doing so because they cannot get the operations and medical care they need.Pregnant women are crossing the border to give birth and mothers go to health centres in Colombia to get their babies vaccinated. Those who cannot leave often spend days and weeks searching for the medication they need. With food increasingly scarce, child malnutrition levels are at a record high. Some of the problems go back a long time, but since the socialist government has been in power since 1999, first under President Hugo Chávez and more recently fronted by President Nicolás Maduro, many Venezuelans blame these two men for what is happening.They say that while the socialist policies of President Chávez may have been aimed at helping the poor - Venezuela was a country of huge inequality when he came to power in 1999 - they backfired. Take price controls, for example. They were introduced by President Chávez to make basic goods more affordable to the poor by capping the price of flour, cooking oil and toiletries. But this meant that the few Venezuelan businesses producing these items soon no longer found it profitable to make them. Critics also blame the foreign currency controls brought in by President Chávez in 2003 for a flourishing black market in dollars. Since then, Venezuelans wanting to exchange bolivars for dollars have had to apply to a government-run currency agency. Only those deemed to have valid reasons to buy dollars, for example to import goods, have been allowed to change their bolivars at a fixed rate set by the government.With many Venezuelans unable to freely buy dollars, they turned to the black market. At one point, the dollar was trading for 6.5m bolivars. But there is still a loyal core of people who support the government and who say that Venezuela's problems are caused not by President Maduro or his predecessor, but by a hostile and coup-mongering opposition inside the country, and \"imperialist forces\" like the US and neighbouring Colombia outside it. They say that US sanctions have hampered the government by making it hard to restructure its debt.Often, they have benefited directly from the government's social programmes - and argue that despite the shortages, they are still better off now than before Mr Chávez came to power in 1999.",

It is expected to weaken as it moves north.Jebi is the first typhoon classed as \"very strong\" by the country's weather agency to make landfall on Japan's main islands since a typhoon left 48 people dead or missing in 1993, Kyodo reports.Hundreds of flights, trains and ferries have had to be cancelled.Flooding covered the runways at Kansai International Airport in Osaka, which is built on a man-made island in a bay.Universal Studios Japan, a popular amusement park near Osaka, was closed.Prime Minister Shinzo Abe convened an emergency meeting and called on people \"to take action to protect your lives, including preparing and evacuating early\".Footage from the storm making landfall showed giant waves crashing against the coastline, and flying debris. Japan's weather agency has warned of possible landslides, flooding and violent winds, as well as high tides, lightning and tornadoes in the areas affected.The country is regularly struck by major storms and this summer has been one of extreme weather.In July landslides and massive floods - the worst in decades - killed more than 200 people. That was followed by a record deadly heatwave. ",

            "content": "The anti-immigrant Slovenian Democratic Party (SDS) has emerged as the largest party in Slovenia's general election.With nearly all votes counted SDS had 25% of the vote, officials said. The centre-left anti-establishment LMS party came second with 12.7%.Analysts say SDS may find it difficult to form a coalition.The poll was called in March after centre-left PM Miro Cerar quit amid strikes, coalition wrangling and a damaging Supreme Court ruling. The SDS  is led by former PM Janez Jansa, who has been a vocal supporter of Hungary's nationalist Prime Minister Viktor Orban.On Sunday evening as the results became clear he said his party's \"door for talks and coalitions is open\" to all other parties.\"We are ready to start serious talks based on the programme we have been working hard on,\" he said.SDS will have 25 seats in the 90-seat assembly. The only party that has so far said it will work with the SDS is the centre-right Nova Slovenija which won 7.1% and has seven seats.That could leave LMS, which will have 13 seats, with a crucial role to play, correspondents say.SDS argues that money spent on migrants would be better used for the country's security forces. Mr Jansa says he wants Slovenia to \"become a country that will put the wellbeing and security of Slovenians first\". LMS (Marjan Sarec List) is led by comedian and political satirist Marjan Sarec who launched himself as an \"anti-establishment\" politician.He described Sunday's result as \"a very big success\" for his party's first election.Some 25 parties were contesting the election with 1.7 million people eligible to vote.Miro Cerar resigned after a Supreme Court ruling went against his flagship railway investment project.His additional troubles in the banking system, the health sector and over pensions will become key issues on the next government's agenda.",

He styles himself as a patriot, fighting to preserve the Slovenian people and the country's distinct identity - in the face of much larger neighbours populated by different ethnic groups. On occasion, this ideological fight has spilled over into real violence. Mr Sisko served a two-year jail sentence after planting a car bomb. He also has a long track record of forming or joining militia groups.He will welcome the publicity gained by his latest stunt. But the public remain indifferent: his United Slovenia Movement gained just 0.6% of the vote in June's general election.National security expert Iztok Prezelj told local media the group had all the markings of a militia: \"They have a flag and uniform, but also from photographs, it's obvious that they have some common emblem on the t-shirts.\"The University of Ljubljana vice-dean added: \"Currently, Slovenia is not at risk of security, so I do not see the need to organise any armed formations, in addition to the army and the police.\"\"The police have not visited me so far but I expect their visit,\" Mr Sisko said. \"We are doing nothing wrong and we would be even interested in cooperating with the police.\"His party, the centre-right United Slovenia Movement, has no connection to the militia, he said.",

Vice-President Delcy Rodríguez said the figures had been inflated by \"enemy countries\" trying to justify a military intervention. She spoke as officials from 13 Latin American countries were meeting to find a way to deal with the mass influx.Ms Rodríguez said the government had complained to the UN Secretary-General António Guterres about \"individual officials\" who she said had been portraying \"a normal migratory flow as a humanitarian crisis to justify an intervention\".Last month, the UN migration agency warned that Venezuela was heading for the same refugee \"crisis moment\" seen in the Mediterranean in 2015.Ms Rodríguez said that the United Nations had used data provided by \"enemy countries\" and presented it \"as if it was their own\".While she did not name the \"enemy countries\", she went on to accuse neighbouring Colombia of asking for international funds ostensibly to deal with Venezuelan migrants on its border, when its real plan was to \"live off\" the donations. Venezuela's government routinely blames neighbouring Colombia for many of its problems, including a failed drone attack on Venezuelan President Nicolás Maduro.While Ms Rodríguez did not say how many Venezuelans had left the country, President Maduro himself put the number at \"no more than 600,000 in the last two years according to confirmed, certified, serious figures\". However, he did not give details about the source of that figure.UN figures for 2017 suggest that number is much higher and data for 2018 indicates migration from Venezuela has been speeding up further as the economic crisis deepens and more Venezuelans report going hungry or not having access to key medicines or medical care. Ms Rodríguez and President Maduro's comments came as migration officials from 13 Latin American countries were attending a two-day meeting in Ecuador to discuss a regional strategy to deal with the influx of Venezuelan migrants.",

Ms Arden was not able to go to Nauru on Monday because of the length of time she would have had to spend away her from 11-week-old daughter.The baby is too young to get the vaccinations required to visit Nauru.On social media, reactions to the trip were mixed.\"[I'm] proud our leader is making the effort [to take] a day trip to get to Nauru,\" said one user on Twitter.But others questioned whether she needed to go at all. \"It's not necessary [for her to attend] if the deputy PM is attending already...\" another added.Ms Ardern said that if she had decided not to attend, that would have made her the first prime minister since 1971 to not attend the Pacific Islands Forum since 1971 outside of an election cycle.

            "title": "Syria war: Why does the battle for Idlib matter?",
            "content": "The war in Syria could be about to enter its final stage, as Syria and its ally Russia gear up for an all-out assault on the rebel-held province of Idlib.The province is the last major stronghold of the rebel and jihadist groups which have been trying to overthrow Mr Assad for the past seven years. The UN says Idlib is home to some 2.9 million people, including 1 million children. More than half of the civilians in Idlib come from other previously rebel-held parts of Syria from which they either fled, or were evacuated.The province also borders Turkey, to the north, and straddles major highways running south from Aleppo to Hama and the capital, Damascus, and west to the Mediterranean coastal city of Latakia. If Idlib is taken by the government, it would leave the rebels with a few pockets of territory scattered across the country and effectively signal their final defeat.The province is not controlled by a single group, but rather by a number of rival factions commanding up to an estimated 30,000 fighters.The dominant force is Hayat Tahrir al-Sham (HTS), a jihadist alliance linked to al-Qaeda. HTS controls key locations across Idlib, including the provincial capital and the Bab al-Hawa border crossing with Turkey. It is designated as a terrorist organisation by the UN, which estimates it has 10,000 fighters in Idlib, including many foreigners.The Turkish-backed National Liberation Front (NLF) is the second most powerful alliance. It was formed this year by rebel factions wanting to counter HTS. They include the big hardline Islamist groups of Ahrar al-Sham and the Nour al-Din al-Zinki Brigades, as well as others fighting under the banner of the Free Syrian Army.The conflict has swung heavily in President Assad's favour. Air strikes by Syria's ally Russia, and support from thousands of fighters backed by Syria's other main ally, Iran, have helped the Syrian military rout rebels elsewhere. On 30 August, Foreign Minister Walid Muallem declared the government's priority was now to \"liberate\" Idlib. He said it wanted to avoid civilian casualties and regain territory through \"reconciliation agreements\", but that it was determined to defeat HTS \"no matter the sacrifices\".Russia also declared that Syria's government had every right to \"liquidate the terrorist threat on its territory\".Turkey, which has troops in Idlib monitoring a previous agreement aimed at lessening fighting in Idblib, has reportedly been negotiating with Russia in an effort to avoid an all-out assault.Turkey, which is already home to more than three million Syrian refugees, fears a major offensive could create a new wave heading towards its border.A full-scale military operation could have devastating consequences in the province. Hundreds of thousands of people there are already experiencing dire conditions in overcrowded sites where basic services have been stretched to breaking point.A senior UN humanitarian official has warned that an attack on Idlib \"will overwhelm capacities and has the potential to create a humanitarian emergency at a scale not yet seen through this crisis\".   The UN says as many as 800,000 people could be displaced and that the already high number of people in need of aid could increase dramatically. It is not clear where those displaced could go because Turkey has shut its border. Adjoining areas controlled by Turkish-backed rebels around Afrin and Jarablus are already overwhelmed by displaced people. And many opposition supporters fear imprisonment if they cross into government territory.The UN's special envoy to Syria, Staffan de Mistura, has called on Russia, Iran and Turkey not to rush into battle.He has proposed two options - to make time for further talks on a political solution; or to \"allow and facilitate a credible humanitarian corridor to allow the civilian population to temporarily evacuate to a safer area\", most likely one under government control. Turkey wants Syria and Russia to postpone the operation, and the three countries' leaders are due to meet in Iran on Friday to discuss the situation. The US, which backed the rebellion against Mr Assad, has said the Syrian government's \"past brutality\" indicated it could not be trusted to protect civilians and called on Russia to intervene.",

He said: \"Those who seek to say Islam is the destruction of other religions are liars.\"The project, agreed between France and Abu Dhabi in 2007, was initially intended to open in 2012 but was delayed by the global financial crisis and plummeting oil prices, sending the final cost soaring over its original $654m (then £340m) budget.In addition, the museum is paying France hundreds of millions of dollars for the use of the Louvre name and for loans of artworks and managerial advice.The museum has attracted its share of controversy over concerns about the welfare of the workers constructing the building.But critics have declared the finished building -  the first to open in a series of projects conceived by UAE authorities at creating a cultural oasis on the Abu Dhabi island of Saadiyat - a \"mesmerising\" success, if with a \"touch of bling\".The Paris Louvre is a landmark in the French capital and the world's largest art museum, with millions of visitors a year.The Abu Dhabi building, designed by French architect Jean Nouvel, brings to mind an Arab medina (an ancient quarter of a city).None of its 55 rooms, including 23 permanent galleries,  is alike.The latticed dome protects visitors from the scalding heat, while allowing the rooms to glow with natural light.On show are works from around the world - from established European masters including Van Gogh, Gaugin and Picasso, to Americans such as James Abbott McNeill Whistler (his painting Whistler's Mother, above) and the modern Chinese artist Ai Weiwei.The museum has also joined force with Arab institutions who have loaned 28 prized works. Among the priceless artefacts on show are a statue of a sphinx dating back to the 6th Century BC and a frieze depicting figures from the Koran.The museum's doors open to the public on Saturday - with all entrance tickets, priced 60 dirhams ($16.80), sold out.Emirati officials will hope the magnificence of the building will put concerns about the wellbeing of its workers and controversy about delays and overrunning costs in the shade.",

            "title": "Who are the Taliban?",
            "content": "The hardline Islamic Taliban movement has proved to be a formidable fighting force in Afghanistan and a major threat to its government.The Taliban have also threatened to destabilise Pakistan, where they have controlled areas in the north-west in recent years. Despite a major military offensive against them since 2014, they continue to mount frequent suicide bombings and other attacks across the country.Many observers now believe that future peace in Afghanistan can only come if the government in Kabul negotiates with the Taliban.The announcement of Taliban plans to open an office in Qatar in June 2013 was seen as a positive step in those negotiations, but mistrust on both sides remains high. Despite this, talks between the Taliban and Afghan government officials took place for the first time in July 2015.Those talks came a month after a group of Afghan women met Taliban representatives in Oslo. Further contacts with the group have failed to make progress.In September 2015, the Afghan Taliban said they had put aside weeks of infighting and rallied around a new leader in the form of Mullah Mansour, who had been the deputy of longstanding leader Mullah Omar.The previous month the Taliban admitted they had covered up Mullah Omar's death for more than two years.Mullah Mansour was killed in a US drone strike in May 2016 and replaced by his deputy Mawlawi Hibatullah Akhundzada, a hardline religious scholar.The Taliban emerged in the early 1990s in northern Pakistan following the withdrawal of Soviet troops from Afghanistan.A predominantly Pashtun movement, the Taliban came to prominence in Afghanistan in the autumn of 1994.It is commonly believed that they first appeared in religious seminaries - mostly paid for by money from Saudi Arabia - which preached a hard line form of Sunni Islam.The Taliban's promise - in Pashtun areas straddling Pakistan and Afghanistan - was to restore peace and security and enforce their own austere version of Sharia, or Islamic law, once in power.In both countries they introduced or supported Islamic punishments - such as public executions of convicted murderers and adulterers and amputations of those found guilty of theft.Men were required to grow beards and women had to wear the all-covering burka.The Taliban banned television, music and cinema and disapproved of girls aged 10 and over from going to school.Pakistan has repeatedly denied that it was the architect of the Taliban enterprise.But there is little doubt that many Afghans who initially joined the movement were educated in madrassas (religious schools) in Pakistan.Pakistan was also one of only three countries, along with Saudi Arabia and the United Arab Emirates (UAE), which recognised the Taliban when they were in power in Afghanistan from the mid-1990s until 2001.It was also the last country to break diplomatic ties with the Taliban.Although Pakistan has in recent years adopted a harder line against Taliban militants carrying out attacks on its soil, Prime Minister Nawaz Sharif - who was elected in May 2013 - has said talking to the militants is one of his priorities.At least three key leaders of the Pakistani Taliban were killed in US drone strikes in 2013. Mullah Nazir was killed in January and Waliur Rehman was killed in May.In November 2013, the group's leader in Pakistan, Hakimullah Mehsud, was killed in a drone strike.But despite these setbacks for the militants, there is evidence that their influence in Karachi has significantly increased. What is arguably one of the most internationally criticised of all Pakistani Taliban attacks took place in October 2012, when schoolgirl Malala Yousafzai was attacked on her way home in the town of Mingora.The attention of the world was drawn to the Taliban in Afghanistan following the attacks on the World Trade Centre in September 2001.The Taliban in Afghanistan were accused of providing a sanctuary to Osama Bin Laden and the al-Qaeda movement who were blamed for the attacks.Soon after 9/11 the Taliban were driven from power in Afghanistan by a US-led coalition, although their leader Mullah Mohammad Omar was not captured.In recent years the Taliban re-emerged in Afghanistan and grew far stronger in Pakistan, where observers say there is loose co-ordination between different Taliban factions and militant groups.The main Pakistani faction was led by Hakimullah Mehsud until his death. His Tehrik-e Taliban Pakistan (TTP) is blamed for dozens of suicide bombings and other attacks.Observers warn against over-stating the existence of one unified insurgency against the Pakistani state, however.For years the Taliban in Afghanistan were led by Mullah Omar, a village clergyman who lost his right eye fighting the occupying forces of the Soviet Union in the 1980s.Afghans, weary of the mujahideen's excesses and infighting after the Soviets were driven out, generally welcomed the Taliban when they first appeared on the scene.Their early popularity was largely due to their success in stamping out corruption, curbing lawlessness and making the roads and the areas under their control safe for commerce to flourish.From south-western Afghanistan, the Taliban quickly extended their influence.They captured the province of Herat, bordering Iran, in September 1995.Exactly one year later, they captured the Afghan capital, Kabul, after overthrowing the regime of President Burhanuddin Rabbani and his defence minister, Ahmed Shah Masood.By 1998, they were in control of almost 90% of Afghanistan.They were accused of various human rights and cultural abuses. One notorious example was in 2001, when the Taliban went ahead with the destruction of the famous Bamiyan Buddha statues in central Afghanistan, despite international outrage.On October 7, 2001, a US-led military coalition invaded Afghanistan and by the first week of December the Taliban regime had collapsed.Mullah Omar and his comrades evaded capture despite one of the largest manhunts in the world. Many senior Taliban leaders take refuge in the Pakistani city of Quetta, from where they guide the Taliban, analysts say. But the existence of what is dubbed the \"Quetta Shura\" is denied by Islamabad, even though there is much evidence to the contrary.Despite ever higher numbers of foreign troops, the Taliban have steadily extended their influence, rendering vast tracts of Afghanistan insecure, and violence in the country has returned to levels not seen since 2001.Their retreat  in the years after 2001 enabled them to limit their human and material losses and return with a vengeance. There have been numerous Taliban attacks on Kabul in recent years and, in September 2012, the group carried out a high-profile raid on Nato's Camp Bastion base.In the same month the US military handed control of the controversial Bagram prison - housing more than 3,000 Taliban fighters and terrorism suspects - to the Afghan authorities.In September 2015 the Taliban seized control of a provincial capital for the first time since their defeat in 2001, taking control of the strategically important city of Kunduz.The US is keeping close to 10,000 troops in Afghanistan, but the Taliban finds itself an increasingly splintered organisation - that is also threatened by the rise of the so-called Islamic State militant group in Afghanistan.",

He has denied wrongdoing but said he would not seek re-election.Later in August Representative Duncan Hunter and his wife were indicted for allegedly using campaign funds to pay for personal expenses. They too deny the charges.The investigation into Mr Hunter began under the presidency of Barack Obama, but the Collins inquiry was launched last year.Both men were early supporters of Mr Trump when he launched his bid for the presidency.The justice department has not commented on the tweet. But it has drawn fire from a number of critics, including Mr Trump's fellow party members.Republican Senator Ben Sasse said the justice department should remain politically neutral in deciding whether or not to prosecute.\"The United States is not some banana republic with a two-tiered system of justice - one for the majority party and one for the minority party. These two men have been charged with crimes because of evidence, not because of who the president was when the investigations began.\"US political scientist and columnist Brian Klass called Mr Trump's outburst \"insane\".No exaggeration: if any other elected leader in a Western democracy tried to instruct their top law enforcement official to shield their political allies from prosecution for political reasons like this, they would be forced to resign within hours. This is insane. https://t.co/i8HpCpDjm0End of Twitter post  by @brianklaasOther critics argue that midterm elections are not a good reason to delay prosecution.Mr. President,Are you suggesting that members of Congress are above the law? The Department of Justice clearly has sufficient evidence to charge Mssrs. Collins and Hunter with felonies. The courts shall decide their guilt or innocence.This is disgraceful.Best Regards,SteveEnd of Twitter post  by @SMKleinmanNo, he's  suggesting that members of Congress who support him are above the law!End of Twitter post  by @JasonHermes77I still can’t get over this tweet. It’s the most outrageous and damning proof of Trump’s utter contempt for the rule of law to come directly out of his mouth. It’s also full of basic and provable lies. It will be Exhibit A in his undoing. https://t.co/IQqdpTvS60End of Twitter post  by @PreetBharara",

            "content": "Brazilian President Michel Temer says the government is seeking funding from companies and banks to help rebuild the National Museum in Rio de Janeiro after it was destroyed by fire.Education Minister Rossieli Soares said international help was also being sought and talks with the UN's cultural body, Unesco, were under way.Museum officials say almost 90% of the collection has been destroyed.Staff have blamed the fire on years of funding cuts.The museum housed one of the largest anthropology and natural history collections in the Americas. It included the 12,000-year-old remains of a woman known as \"Luzia\".On Monday, President Temer's office said he had held talks with officials from major Brazilian banks and businesses to examine ways to reconstruct the museum \"as soon as possible\".Addressing reporters outside the ruined building, Mr Soares said the federal government had set aside an initial 15m reais (£2.8m; $3.6m) to rebuild the structure and restore its collection. An investigation has been launched but Culture Minister Sergio Leitao told the Estado de S.Paulo newspaper that the most likely causes were an electrical fault or a homemade paper hot-air balloon landing on the roof.The fire started on Sunday evening, after the building - a 19th Century former royal palace - closed for the day.It is not yet clear if the museum was insured.The city's fire chief, Roberto Robadey, said nearby hydrants were dry when emergency services arrived. He said crews had to get water from a nearby lake and from tanker trucks.\"Yesterday was one of the saddest days of my career,\" he said.On Monday, fire crews were sifting through the charred wreckage, occasionally emerging with an artefact or a painting they had managed to rescue.Riot police fired tear gas outside the park housing the museum on Monday as a small, irate crowd tried to enter.Many demonstrators were angry at the budget cuts that they say led to the fire. The protesters were later allowed to surround the museum's perimeter in a symbolic \"embrace.\" Luiz Fernando Dias Duarte, a deputy director at the museum, expressed \"immense anger\", and accused Brazilian authorities of a \"lack of attention\".\"We fought years ago, in different governments, to obtain resources to adequately preserve everything that was destroyed today,\" he said.One issue appears to be the lack of a sprinkler system. Mr Duarte told Globo TV that a $5.3m (£4.1m) modernisation plan agreed in June would have included modern fire prevention equipment, but only after October's elections.Roberto Leher, rector of the Rio de Janeiro federal university which administers the museum, said the community was \"very mobilised, and very indignant\".\"We all knew the building was vulnerable,\" he said.The flames tore through hundreds of rooms containing some 20 million artefacts. They ranged from fossils and the reconstructed skeleton of a dinosaur to Roman frescoes and pre-Columbian Brazilian objects.The jewel in the crown for many visitors was \"Luzia\"  - the oldest human remains ever discovered in Latin America.\"Luzia is a priceless loss for everyone interested in civilisation,\" museum director Paulo Knauss told AFP news agency.Using her skull, experts had produced a digital image of her face, which was used as the basis for a sculpture that was also gutted by the fire.Another popular exhibit was the Bendegó meteorite, weighing more than five tonnes and discovered in Minas Gerais region in the 18th Century.Deputy director Cristiana Serejo said it had survived along with part of the zoological collection, the library and some ceramics.

            "title": "Russia-Trump: Who's who in the drama to end all dramas?",
            "content": "It's more gripping than any box set we can get our hands on right now.The investigations into Russian interference in the US election, and whether the Trump campaign colluded with the Kremlin, continue to deliver daily developments and drama worthy of anything seen in House of Cards. Thirty-two people have now been charged by Robert Mueller, the special counsel investigating Russian interference in the 2016 election.  Here is a guide to the main characters in the first four seasons of the only political drama that matters.This is the season in which Donald Trump, the reality TV star, takes centre stage in his own political drama by launching a presidential campaign. He's supported by his family and gets the attention of the Russians. The season ends with a cliffhanger - could Trump the outsider actually win?!It's been a while since all of this happened, so let's remind you of the key players in this season.Who is he? Donald Trump, the billionaire candidate (who by Season Three is the 45th president of the United States). If you really need a refresher, here's his life story.Key plot line As Donald Trump was busy traversing the country canvassing for votes, US intelligence officials said Russia hacked into the emails of his Democratic rivals.The question is why? Was the Kremlin trying to alter the outcome of the election, and what did Trump and his campaign know?What, if anything, did Donald Trump do to try to cover things up in the ongoing Russia investigation? Who is he? He was Trump's campaign chairman before being forced to quit over his ties to Russian oligarchs and Ukraine.Key plot line Paul Manafort spent more than a decade as a political consultant in Ukraine. He resigned from the campaign in August 2016, after he was accused of having links to pro-Russian groups there. He also sat in on a crucial meeting with a Russian lawyer who may have been trying to feed the Trump team classified information (more on that later).After an FBI raid on his home later on - in Season Three - Manafort is found guilty on eight charges of tax fraud, bank fraud and failing to disclose foreign banks accounts the season after.The big question that comes after that is will he start co-operating with investigators - and risk the anger of his former boss Trump - in return for a lenient sentence? Another trial, on charges of money laundering and illegal lobbying, looms over him.Read more: The man who helped Trump winWho is he? The president's eldest child. The Trump who we know did meet the Russians - the big question is why.Key plot line The role of Donald Trump Jr in this unfolding saga all comes down to a meeting he had with a Russian lawyer, which was set up by a music publicist (the full details of which come out in Season Three). If it sounds random, then in many ways it is.In June 2016, the publicist, Rob Goldstone, offered him a meeting with lawyer Natalia Veselnitskaya promising Trump Jr dirt on Hillary Clinton. \"This is obviously very high level and sensitive information but is part of Russia and its government's support for Mr Trump,\" Goldstone wrote. \"I love it\" Trump Jr replied, and so he invited the pair to Trump Tower, where they met Trump staff Jared Kushner and Paul Manafort.This meeting is the key to much of our plot line because it raises several key questions. Did this amount to the campaign colluding with a foreign government? Why did he agree to the meeting? Don Jr said the meeting was about Russian adoption policy, but his father later said it was about political opposition research. Mr Trump's lawyers say he dictated his son's first misleading explanation, leading to questions of whether the president sought to obstruct a Justice Department inquiry. What happened at the meeting is the scene investigators will be playing over and over again as they try to work out if there was any impropriety. Read more: Trump Jr's habit for making headlinesDonald Trump confounds his critics by winning the presidency. But the transition is as gripping as the season before it as Trump picks his cabinet, introducing key characters to the mix. The season ends with Trump taking the oath of office on a cold January morning - but there are more twists to come.Who is he? The granite-faced former general who later became the shortest-serving member of Donald Trump's cabinet. He resigned after not being honest about his contact with a Russian official - and was later charged with making false statements to the FBI.Key plot line Michael Flynn was appointed national security adviser just days after the election, against the advice of then-President Obama, who warned Trump not to hire him. Flynn's starring role came in December 2016, when he spoke to the Russian ambassador, Sergei Kislyak.The Washington Post and New York Times said the men discussed Russian sanctions, and that Flynn later lied to the Vice President Mike Pence about the conversation (Mr Kislyak said the men discussed only \"simple things\").The substance of those talks eventually led to Flynn being prosecuted as part of the investigation led by special counsel Robert Mueller.On 1 December 2017, Mr Flynn pleaded guilty to making \"false, fictitious and fraudulent statements\" to the FBI about what he and Kislyak discussed. The investigation reached Trump's inner circle.Read more: Out after 23 days - who is Michael Flynn?Who is he? Many roads in this drama lead back to Sergei Kislyak, the jolly and charismatic figure, who up until July 2017 was the Russian ambassador to Washington. Key plot line Kislyak's role in this drama is unclear - but he makes several appearances as the man many of our cast have had meetings with. The key questions for investigators are - why were they drawn to him, and what was said? The Russian ambassador spoke to both Flynn and Sessions - meetings which both Trump officials didn't initially acknowledge took place.Anything else we should know? Well, Russia fiercely fought back against claims on CNN that Kislyak was a \"top spy and recruiter of spies\".Who is he? Jefferson Beauregard Sessions III hovered in the background during Season One, when he was an Alabama senator and a trusted Trump adviser, but we really got to know him during Season Two, when he became Trump's nominee for attorney general.Key plot line Sessions is one of a number of Trump's team to meet the Russian ambassador, Sergei Kislyakand there are question marks over the nature of those meetings.Since the FBI investigation focused on the Trump campaign, Sessions stood down from the inquiry. That decision led to plenty of tension, with Trump taking potshot after potshot at Sessions on Twitter.Sessions has said any suggestion he colluded with Russia is \"an appalling and detestable lie\".In January, it was revealed that Sessions had been questioned by Mueller. He appeared to be first member of Trump's cabinet to be interviewed. Read more: An attorney general dogged by scandalThis is where the drama really picked up and all the plot lines came together. A lot of the background characters we saw in Season One came back with a vengeance and the infighting got nasty - and, don't look now, but the police are circling.Who is she? A Russian lawyer with a fearsome reputation who has fought against US restrictions on Russia. But is she a Kremlin stooge? In November 2017 she told the US Senate: \"I operate independently of any governmental bodies\". But in April 2018 she admitted in an interview with NBC News to being an \"informant\" for Russia's prosecutor general.Key plot line Hers is a small but crucial role - she's the one who Trump Jr, Kushner and Manafort met in June 2016, the details of which began trickling out a year later once Trump became president. She says the meeting was to discuss adoptions - but those who helped set it up said she was offering dirt on the Democrats and Hillary Clinton's campaign. In June 2018 Mr Trump tweeted that the meeting was \"to get information on an opponent, totally legal and done all the time in politics\".That meeting would never have happened without...Who are they? Emin Agalarov is Azerbaijan's biggest pop star, of course. Have you not heard Love is a Deadly Game? Emin helped bring Donald Trump's Miss Universe competition to Russia and the two are close enough to send each other birthday messages. His dad, Aras, is a billionaire who mixes in the highest circles of influence in Moscow.Key plot line Emin is the man who set the wheels in motion on that Trump Jr meeting. An email sent to Trump Jr suggests Emin was offering information on the Democrats (Emin says he didn't). The email also says Aras Agalarov had apparently met the \"crown prosecutor\" of Russia - a role that weirdly doesn't exist - and got information on Hillary Clinton. Are you keeping up?Read more: The tough-talking networkerWho is she? One of those supporting characters who came from nowhere to play a massive role in the rest of the season. She was the acting attorney general, until Sessions was confirmed in his role. And then she was fired...Key plot line She's the one who informed the White House that Flynn had not been truthful about his meetings with the Russians. She argued that the fact the Russians knew about these meetings, and that the White House didn't, made Flynn vulnerable to blackmail. Her reward? Donald Trump fired her over an unrelated matter weeks later. She's been a persistent critic of the president ever since.Who is he? He became deputy attorney general under Jeff Sessions In the TV drama of the Russia scandal, this is the sort of role that would go to a solid Broadway actor you recognise but can't put a name to. Key plot line Given Sessions stood down from leading the main investigation into the Trump-Russia ties, it fell to Rosenstein to do that job. In a major plot development, he appointed a special investigator - not a popular move with the White House. He's also the guy who recommended in a letter that FBI chief Comey be fired. That move proved to be a bit more popular with the president.Read more: The man at the centre of Comey sackingWho is he? Married to Trump's daughter, Ivanka, Kushner is the character who is seen but very rarely heard.Key plot line Amid cries of nepotism, he was given a plum White House job as senior adviser to the president with a wide-ranging portfolio. It's his contacts with the Russians during the election campaign and beyond that have led to investigators circling him. In June 2016, Kushner attended THAT meeting with Donald Trump Jr and the Russian lawyer. He says he was so bored he messaged his assistant to call him so he could leave.Kushner is also another cast member who had repeated contact with Russian ambassador Sergei Kislyak - contact that he initially failed to disclose.Read more: The son-in-law with Trump's earWho is he? A British former tabloid journalist, with a penchant for selfies in silly hats, is perhaps an unlikely addition to the cast, but in most good dramas there's always room for the slightly out-of-place eccentric.Key plot line Rob Goldstone finds his way into Donald Trump's circle of trust thanks to his connections with Russian pop star Emin Agalarov.Goldstone manages the pop star, and it was he who contacted Donald Trump Jr on behalf of his client to set up that now-infamous meeting at Trump Tower in June 2016. Goldstone sent an email to Trump Jr promising dirt on Hillary Clinton, in an email exchange that is a key piece of evidence in this inquiry.Another highlight on Goldstone's CV is his work bringing the Miss Universe contest to Russia, and it is through these connections he once met Donald Trump himself.Read more: The Music Man with a love for hatsWho is he? At 6ft 8in (just over two metres), James Comey is a towering figure, the character who gives little away about himself personally, but has a huge personal role in this story.Key plot line He first entered this drama in Season One, when as head of the FBI he reopened the investigation into Hillary Clinton's emails - just weeks before the election. Democrats blamed him for her loss, Republicans hailed him a hero. That, we thought, was the last we'd seen of him.Cue Season Three, when months into the Trump presidency, Comey was fired by the new president. In true television drama style, he learned of his sacking as he was watching TV news during a trip to LA. By this point, Comey was heading up an investigation into possible ties between the Trump campaign and Russia. Was this why he was given the heave-ho?His testimony to the Senate was one of the most gripping scenes in this drama so far, as  - under oath - he told politicians he was asked to pledge loyalty to the president - but refused. He also said he was told by Trump to \"let go\" of the investigation into Michael Flynn. A character whose stock is still high - it's unclear when he'll next make an appearance.Read more: The FBI director who took centre stageWho is he? A former election adviser to Trump, although you'd be forgiven if you didn't remember the face. He was in only a few scenes in Season Two, but he had a massive role to play in Season Three, becoming the first person to plead guilty as part of the investigation.Key plot line In late October 2017, court documents emerged showing Papadopoulos had pleaded guilty to lying to the FBI about the timing of meetings with alleged go-betweens for Russia.He falsely claimed that he had met two figures with Russian connections before joining the Trump campaign in March 2016. In fact, he met them after joining the campaign. After lying to the FBI, he deleted an incriminating Facebook account and destroyed a phone.His guilty plea has the potential to damage the US leader because it relates directly to his campaign, analysts say. And, it turns out, he has been co-operating with Mueller's investigation. What has he revealed? And who has he implicated?Read more: Why Papadopoulos case mattersWho is he? The man who could decide the fate of the Trump presidency.  Key plot line Some characters wield a lot of power, but don't have a starring role, such as Robert Mueller, the tall chiselled figure who was appointed as \"special counsel\" to take over the Russia investigation in the wake of the dismissal of James Comey. Mueller comes from the same stock as Comey - both are former heads of the FBI. It's led some to accuse Mueller of not being impartial.There have been reports that the president has considered firing Mueller - but he's still in the job. With a team of more than 15 lawyers, and a staff of more than three dozen, he's working quietly behind the scenes amassing evidence.Mueller's inquiry runs alongside similar ones being conducted by politicians in Congress - but he's the only one who can press charges against anyone.He plays a big part in Season Four onward.After Season Three ended with the first charges being laid down by Robert Mueller, things really speed up in Season Four. The president's fury with the special counsel investigation increases, but investigators continue to circle.Who is he? OK, he's not Putin's chef any more, but he once was - now he's the man accused of spearheading Russia's attempts to interfere in the 2016 election.Key plot line A little out of the blue, Mueller announces charges against Prigozhin and 12 other Russians, accusing them of tampering with the US election by (among other things) organising and promoting political rallies in the US.They're also said to have tried to buy a cage large enough to hold an actress dressed as Hillary Clinton in a prison costume. Russia has dismissed the accusation.Read more: Seven key takeaways from indictmentWho is he? He worked alongside Paul Manafort as a consultant, and became an aide to the Trump campaign in 2016. He floated around the edges of Season One, so you wouldn't have seen that much of him.Key plot line He was charged along with Manafort, and eventually pleaded guilty to charges of conspiracy and lying to investigators (despite maintaining his innocence). His plea deal, and decision to co-operate with investigators, means he may have some interesting things to say - he actually stayed with the Trump campaign for some time after Manafort left, so was right in the middle of things.Who is he? The man who once said he would take a bullet for Donald Trump - but who instead ended up dumping him deep in trouble.Key plot line Cohen, as Trump's long-time personal lawyer, lingered around the edges of the plot for the first three seasons, but became the big player of the fourth.When Mueller's team began looking into Cohen's finances, they passed on their concerns to investigators in New York.Then, in August 2018, Cohen pleaded guilty to violating campaign finance laws after paying hush money to Trump's alleged mistresses during the campaign. He said he did so after instructions by \"the candidate\" - presumed to be the man who later became president.With this, the plot took an unexpected new turn.Text by Rajini Vaidyanathan and Roland Hughes; illustrations by Gerry Fletcher",

In many homes that have been chlorinated, water had not receded. This was inevitable,\" he added. So far the illness has been detected in five of the 13 districts that were hit by flooding.\"All the hospitals are well equipped with penicillin as well. Guidelines have also been issued to private hospitals on how to treat patients with rat fever,\" Dr Saritha R, the director of health services in Kerala, said. Leptospriosis (also called Weil's disease) is spread through rats or animal fluids, and can enter the human body through small cuts in the skin or through the eyes, nose and mouth.It is caused by the leptospiro bacteria.Symptoms include fever, nausea, muscle aches, vomiting, and diarrhoea.\"Rats drown in flood water which contaminates it further, allowing the leptospiro bacteria to enter the human body through the skin,\" said Dr V Ravi, a professor of virology at India's National Institute of Mental Health and Neuro sciences.

            "content": "The founder of the Haqqani militant network has died after several years of illness, the Afghan Taliban has announced.Jalaluddin Haqqani was a significant militant figure in Afghanistan and had close ties to both the Taliban and al-Qaeda.His son is believed to have taken over control of the group in 2001.The Haqqani network has been behind many of the co-ordinated attacks on Afghan and Nato forces in recent years.There were no details in the statement about the date or place of Haqqani's death.\"Just as he endured great hardships for the religion of Allah during his youth and health, he also endured long illness during his later years,\" a statement from the Afghan Taliban said. Rumours about Haqqani's death have circulated for years. In 2015, sources close to the group told the BBC that the leader had died at least a year earlier. This was never confirmed. Jalaluddin Haqqani was an Afghan guerrilla leader who fought Soviet troops when they occupied Afghanistan in the 1980s.US officials have admitted that at the time he was a prized asset of the Central Intelligence Agency (CIA).However, he later allied himself to the Taliban after they took power in Afghanistan in 1996.In its statement, the Taliban called Jalaluddin Haqqani an \"exemplary warrior... and among the great distinguished jihadi personalities of this era\".The Haqqani network was one of several militant groups that operated from the tribal areas along the Afghan-Pakistan border following the US-led military campaign in Afghanistan, which ousted the Taliban in 2001.The group, which it is alleged largely operates from Pakistan, has also been blamed for some of the deadliest attacks in Afghanistan, including a truck bomb explosion in Kabul in 2017 that killed more than 150 people.Mahfouze Zubaide, BBC News, KabulJalaluddin Haqqani may not have been playing a significant operational or strategic role at the time of his death, but his loss is still significant for the militant group he founded. Although he was no longer a key player - having ceded control to his son Sirajuddin Haqqani some years ago - it is widely believed that he still played an advisory role, and his death will be a huge emotional loss for the group.The Haqqani network currently remains among the most powerful and feared militant groups in Afghanistan - some say it has more clout than other outfits such as the Islamic State group. Haqqani militants have been blamed for numerous deadly terror attacks in the country, including last year's suicide truck blast in the capital. It is significant that the Taliban have chosen to emphasise that he died of \"natural causes\" and after a long illness. This seems to be a direct reference to multiple rumours of his death earlier.

Given that a number of major cases loom on the Supreme Court's horizon, his views and positions - and how he might vote on the closely divided court - will be closely scrutinised. Here are four areas where the new nominee might feel the most heat.Upon news that Mr Kennedy was retiring, liberals and legal commentators were quick to warn that the legality of abortions across the US hangs in the balance The Reagan-appointed justice had been one of five votes effectively upholding the landmark Roe v Wade decision in 1992, In 2016 he was the decisive vote striking down stringent Texas regulations that would have shuttered all but a handful of abortion clinics in the state. Depending on whom Mr Trump picked, those types of laws could proliferate - or Roe v Wade itself, the 1973 Supreme Court ruling that legalised abortion nationwide, could be overturned.Social conservatives were pining for a more clearly anti-abortion choice, like Judge Amy Coney Barrett. Mr Kavanaugh's nomination gives them some reason for pause. While he disagreed with a circuit court decision allowing an undocumented immigrant teenager in government detention to seek an abortion, in the mind of anti-abortion advocates he was not sufficiently forceful in his dissent.In another case, Mr Kavanaugh sided with a group of priests who did not want their government-mandated healthcare plans to offer contraception - but, in his opinion, he noted that the government had a \"compelling interest\" in providing such insurance coverage.One anti-abortion group, the American Family Association, is on the record opposing his confirmation - and others have expressed some displeasure.On the other side of the political divide, abortion rights groups have been sharply critical of Mr Kavanaugh. They point to his use of the term \"abortion on demand\" in his decision on the teenage immigrant as an example of his endorsement of anti-abortion language. And virtually any Trump pick was going to be attacked, given that the president explicitly promised during his campaign that he would pick Supreme Court justices who would overturn Roe v Wade.On the Docket: It probably won't be long before the truth about Kavanaugh comes out. An Iowa law banning abortion once a foetal heartbeat is detected - as early as six weeks into pregnancy - is already being challenged in court and could work its way up to the Supreme Court in just a few years. It's the kind of case that could give anti-abortion activists a chance to realise a dream decades in the making - for decisions on the legality of abortion to once again rest in the hands of state governments, not courts.As a long-serving judge on the District of Columbia Circuit Court of Appeals, which has jurisdiction over a range of cases involving the federal government, Mr Kavanaugh has had plenty of opportunity to weigh in on questions involving presidential authority and powers. In January, he dissented from a decision upholding a law that prevents a president from removing the head of the Consumer Finance Protection Bureau - a government agency created during the Obama administration to oversee the credit card, student loan and mortgage industries - ruling that it was a violation of executive authority.Perhaps most noteworthy, in 2009 Mr Kavanaugh penned an article for the Minnesota Law Review in which he argued that Congress should pass a law shielding presidents from civil lawsuits and criminal prosecution while in office. \"The president's job is difficult enough as it is,\" he wrote. \"And the country loses when the president's focus is distracted by the burdens of civil litigation or criminal investigation and possible prosecution.\"On the Docket: It doesn't take an enormous stretch to imagine where this sort of logic could come into play. There are already rumours aplenty that Robert Mueller's special counsel investigation into possible ties between Russia and the Trump presidential campaign could be considering obstruction of justice charges against the president. Such a move would almost surely lead to a legal challenge that ends up before the Supreme Court.In one final ironic twist, Mr Kavanaugh was an assistant to Ken Starr's long-running investigation of President Bill Clinton in the 1990s - and back then he helped argue that the then-president could be subject to criminal charges.Mr Kavanaugh was reportedly the preferred choice of White House adviser Stephen Miller, the iron fist behind Mr Trump's immigration policy. That should speak volumes about how the administration views the new nominee's position on this hot-button topic.In particular, immigration hardliners point to a 2014 Kavanaugh dissent in which he laments that a skilled visa programme was being used by a restaurant to bring in foreign labourers. \"Mere economic expediency does not authorise an employer to displace American workers for foreign workers,\" he wrote.In another dissent, Mr Kavanaugh wrote in 2008 that a union election should have been voided because undocumented workers had participated.Several other names on Mr Trump's Supreme Court short-list had been derided by grass-roots conservatives as being \"pro-amnesty\" for undocumented migrants (Raymond Kethledge) or having done free legal work for undocumented migrants (Thomas Hardiman). On the Docket: It is probably only a matter of time before more of Mr Trump's immigration actions come before the court - perhaps including one of the legal challenges to his border enforcement policies that have resulted in the separation of undocumented immigrant families.Up until two weeks ago, when the Supreme Court by a one-vote majority upheld Mr Trump's travel ban, the judiciary had been a frustrating roadblock to the president's effort to enact his immigration policies. Mr Kavanaugh, at least in the minds of the immigration hard-liners, will keep the end of the legal road clear.It's not as sexy as the other topics on this list, but one of the areas where Mr Kavanaugh may make the biggest impact is his firm views on the need to curtail the power of the federal bureaucracy.It all goes back to a 1984 decision, Chevron v Natural Resources Defense Council, in which a unanimous court held that when congressional intent in crafting a law is unclear, the executive agency in charge of administering that law should be given wide latitude.The Chevron precedent has effectively given presidents - and the executive branch - significant power to interpret laws as they see fit, often to the dismay of small-government conservatives. Mr Kavanaugh has written that the Chevron decision has \"no basis\" in law and was an \"atextual invention\" by the Supreme Court that encourages presidential administrations to be \"extremely aggressive in seeking to squeeze its policy goals into ill-fitting statutory authorisations\".On the Docket: The new nominee wouldn't be alone on the court in taking aim at Chevron - it's been a prime target of criticism by Neil Gorsuch, as well. Citations of and requests for \"Chevron deference\" come up like clockwork every term, so it wouldn't be long before Mr Kavanaugh has a chance to take a hatchet to a key support structure for the administrative state.",

            "title": "Haqqanis: Growth of a militant network",
            "content": "US officials have blamed co-ordinated attacks in Kabul on the Haqqani militant network. The Haqqanis have grown from a CIA-backed anti-Soviet group into one of the most feared anti-Western militant organisations in the region, writes the BBC's M Ilyas Khan in Islamabad.The so-called Haqqani network of militants has been blamed for several high profile attacks against Western, Indian and government targets in Afghanistan.It is often described by Pakistani officials as a predominantly Afghan militant group.But its roots reach deep inside Pakistani territory, and speculation over its links to some powerful quarters within the Pakistani security establishment refuse to die down.The leader of the group, Jalaluddin Haqqani, is a Jadran tribesman from Afghanistan's Paktia province. He owns properties in the neighbouring North Waziristan tribal region of Pakistan.North Waziristan was the base from where he organised raids against the former Soviet troops that occupied Afghanistan in 1980s.American officials admit that Mr Haqqani was a prized asset of the Central Intelligence Agency (CIA) back then.He was also one of the favourite commanders of Pakistan's Inter Services Intelligence (ISI) that decided which commander should get how much international funds and equipment to fight the Soviets.Many in the West and Pakistan believe he is still an asset of the ISI, though the Pakistani military denies this. They say the outreach of the Haqqanis would be far too limited without the material, tactical and logistical support of powerful elements in Pakistan.But in a recent interview with the BBC, Jalaluddin Haqqani's son and its current leader, Sirajuddin Haqqani, has said there have \"never been contacts by intelligence agencies of other countries (including Pakistan) which could be effective for us\".A late convert to Taliban, Mr Haqqani was one of their top leaders to undertake a last official visit to Islamabad in late 2001, at about the time as the US started to bomb Afghanistan.Mr Haqqani disappeared in Islamabad, and resurfaced several months later in the Waziristan region where he is credited with carving out the first base of militant resistance against Western forces in the most recent conflict in Afghanistan.To this day, militants operating out of this base have inflicted more damage than any other group on Western troops in Afghanistan.The more lethal of these militants are the Pakistani fighters, called Punjabi Taliban by locals in Waziristan, and the so-called foreign fighters of Arab and central Asian origin.These fighters constitute the bulk of Haqqani network's fighting force.The growing strength of Waziristan-based militants is seen as having turned the tide against the Americans in Afghanistan in recent years.Waziristan is seen as the source of Taliban resistance in Kunar and Ningarhar provinces in the north-east of the country, and in the southern militant strongholds of Zabul, Kandahar and Helmand.When the Americans started their bombing campaign in Afghanistan in late October 2001, thousands of Arab and Central Asian fighters started to pour into South Waziristan.Some half-hearted attempts by the Pakistani army to check this influx led to a violent conflict in the Wana region of South Waziristan in 2002, and again in 2004.More than 700 Pakistani soldiers were killed in those clashes.Subsequently, Pakistanis backed down and allowed militant groups to establish deeper roots there.By 2006, several local militant groups had emerged across the whole of South Waziristan and North Waziristan, converting the entire area into a virtual no-go zone for Pakistani officials.Based in different geographical locations within the region, these groups had different, sometimes conflicting, aims and agendas.Some of these groups signed peace deals with the Pakistani army, which still hold.Others were hostile to it and conducted violent campaigns against government and civilian targets in Pakistani cities and towns. But all groups were largely under the influence of the Haqqanis, and like them, professed allegiance to Mullah Omar, the Taliban's spiritual leader.Jalaluddin Haqqani's son, Sirajuddin, was the chief negotiator who united various clans of the Ahmadzai Wazir tribe in Wana region of South Waziristan in 2006.He is also believed to have been instrumental in persuading Baitullah Mehsud, the anti-Pakistan militant commander based in eastern parts of South Waziristan, to negotiate peace with the Pakistani forces in 2005 and again in 2008.While these peace deals did not hold, collaboration between the Haqqanis and Mehsud's TTP group continued.They were both blamed for organising a December 2009 suicide attack in Khost province of Afghanistan in which seven CIA operatives were killed.There is evidence that some top members of the Haqqani network have also been operating in the Pakistani mainland, away from their sanctuary in the Waziristan region.Between 2008 and 2011, two brothers of Jalaluddin Haqqani, along with some other leaders of the group, have been trying to negotiate peace between the TTP - now headed by Hakimullah Mehsud - and the Shia Turi tribe of the Kurram tribal region.At least three rounds of talks have so far been held in Peshawar, the capital of the north-western Khyber Pakhtunkhwa province, and in Islamabad.This serves as an indication of the extent to which the Haqqanis can influence and shape the militant scene in Pakistan and the freedom with which they can move both within the semi-autonomous tribal areas and the Pakistani and Afghan mainlands.",

            "content": "President Donald Trump's nominee for the vacant Supreme Court seat is set to face the first of four days of Senate hearings on Tuesday.  Brett Kavanaugh, a Catholic, would tilt the court's balance to the right if approved by the Senate. Many Democrats strongly oppose Mr Trump's choice as they fear a more socially conservative approach to abortion and gay rights.Mr Kavanaugh, 53, will be grilled by the Senate Judiciary Committee.The senators will also hear from witnesses for and against the nominee.  The nine-justice court has until now been balanced between conservatives and liberals, with Anthony Kennedy considered the \"swing vote\". He retired in July. Mr Kavanaugh is a conservative and Democrats say he could erode abortion rights, which are enshrined in the 1973 Roe v. Wade ruling, is opposed to gay rights and is pro-gun. They are also concerned about his belief that a sitting president should be immune from prosecution. The Supreme Court might have to rule on the issue should Special Counsel Robert Mueller decide that Mr Trump may have violated campaign finance laws. The campaign finance issue emerged as part of Mr Mueller's investigation into allegations of collusion between the Trump election campaign and Russia. The president's lawyers have vowed to fight any subpoena request all the way to the highest court. The Trump administration has also angered Democrats by refusing to release 27,000 documents relating to Mr Kavanaugh's time as part of the legal team serving President George W Bush.  The White House cited \"constitutional privilege\". Democrats - currently in the minority in the House and the Senate - also dislike his opposition to the Affordable Care Act - Obamacare - as a US Court of Appeals judge. On the release of documents, Republicans say Democrats have more than enough information to make their judgement - and more than 120,000 documents were made available relating to the nominee's time in the Bush White House. Senate Republican leader Mitch McConnell tweeted his support on Friday. The American Bar Association “has determined by a unanimous vote that Judge Kavanaugh is ‘Well Qualified’ for the position of Associate Justice of the Supreme Court” – its highest possible rating. Leading Democrats’ have called this the Gold Standard.End of Twitter post  by @SenateMajLdrIt is thought likely. He faces up to three days of questioning from the Senate Judiciary Committee, including the senior Democrat Diane Feinstein. More than 20 witnesses are being called. \"There will be sparks at this hearing,\" Senator Richard Blumenthal, also a Democrat, has predicted. Assuming he clears that hurdle, it will be up to the full Senate to decide. Republicans have a slim majority in the 100-seat upper house, and most have declared they will back him.Not all Democrats have said they will oppose him and it is thought some could even support Mr Kavanaugh's nomination. A resident of the wealthy Washington suburb of Chevy Chase, Mr Kavanaugh studied law at Yale. He worked under special counsel Kenneth Starr in his investigation into President Bill Clinton's relationship with intern Monica Lewinsky in the 1990s. Under George W Bush, he served as deputy White House counsel and, from 2003 to 2006, as Bush's staff secretary. Mr Kavanaugh is likely to have been involved in a range of issues, including the so-called war on terrorism and discussions about how to deal with enemy combatants.  He has been a US Court of Appeals judge in Washington for the past 11 years. ",

            "title": "Nasiruddin Haqqani: Who shot the militant at the bakery?",
            "content": "At first it appeared as if two men had been injured in a gun attack at a bread shop in the eastern suburbs of Pakistan's capital, Islamabad - just a routine shooting, a senseless crime in a large city.  But eyewitnesses noticed a number of aberrations. Some told local press that the police who arrived at the crime scene collected bullet casings and other evidence and then washed the area down to clean away the blood stains.  One of the  injured was taken to a nearby house, witnesses said.  Later, the injured man - or was he dead by then? - was put in a vehicle and driven away in the presence of senior police officers.Local police registered a report saying unknown assailants on a motorbike injured a naan-bread maker at a suburban market. When confronted by the reporters, they denied there had been a second injured man.The capital's main hospitals also reported only one casualty from the scene - one Mohammad Farooq, the naan maker.But by mid-afternoon on Monday rumours were swirling that the second mystery man hit in the attack was in fact Nasiruddin Haqqani, a key leader of the so-called Haqqani network, considered one of the deadliest Afghan Taliban groups fighting Western forces in Afghanistan.Confirming the rumours, a relative of Mr Haqqani told BBC his body had been spirited from Islamabad to the town of Miranshah in North Waziristan - roughly six hours drive across two provinces and one federal tribal territory, all dotted with heavily-manned military and police checkpoints.There are obvious reasons for this cover-up. For years, Pakistan has been accused by the West of backing the Haqqani network to counter the influence of arch-rival India in Afghanistan, a charge it denies.So the idea that some of the group's key leaders were freely moving around in Islamabad - and even had a permanent home in the city, as has become apparent following the attack - could cause the country some embarrassment, a reminder of what it faced in 2011 when al-Qaeda leader Osama Bin Laden was killed by the Americans in a Pakistani city.Nasiruddin was the son of Jalaluddin Haqqani, a veteran of the Afghan war against the Soviets in the 1980s who then set up the Haqqani network to fight the Americans in the post-9/11 era.He was also the elder brother of Sirajuddin Haqqani, who heads the Haqqani network these days.The Haqqanis belong to the Jadran tribe which is a native of eastern Afghanistan's Loya, or greater, Paktia region, and pledge allegiance to the Afghan Taliban leader Mullah Omar.But they have their main sanctuary in Pakistan's tribal territory of Waziristan and maintain operational independence from the Afghan Taliban.The group is known for launching spectacular attacks against Western and Indian targets in Afghanistan.And it is known to have played a prominent role in seeking to bring the anti-Pakistan militant groups in the Pakistani Taliban (TTP) alliance to the dialogue table with Islamabad.Nasiruddin Haqqani was not central to the group's military operations, but had a vital role as a fundraiser and emissary who frequently travelled to the sheikhdoms of the Middle East to raise cash, and also, according to some reports, to look after his family business there.He also played a part in last year's efforts to set up a Taliban office in Doha for peace talks with the United States, although the Haqqani network was not a direct interlocutor in those talks.In addition, he was understood to be the group's main contact person for pro-Taliban elements in Pakistan, and was frequently seen moving around in Islamabad.According to local residents, some family members of Nasiruddin Haqqani had been living in the Shahpur area on Islamabad's eastern outskirts for well over four years.He was apparently using this base to organise financial and logistical support for his group and the Afghan Taliban.So there were a number of groups who could have wanted to see him dead.Analysts believe his assassination has dealt a blow to the group's fundraising activities, because they think Nasiruddin was the only Haqqani free to exploit his father's vast Middle Eastern contacts. The others are either dead, or engaged in operational matters.Some quarters also suggest he was Islamabad's main link to the TTP leadership in its recent peace overtures to that group.For these circles, the obvious suspects behind his killing would be either the Americans or the Afghans.But others point to growing unease within the wider Taliban community in the North Waziristan sanctuary as the time for Nato's drawdown in Afghanistan gets nearer.This unease is partly due to a fluid situation in Pakistan, where the political and military establishments are putting up a half-hearted battle against some right-wing politicians who appear bent on exploiting the anti-American feelings in the country to push it into international isolation.  Tribal sources say there is a clear split within the TTP, with some ethnic Mehsud commanders accusing the Haqqanis of toeing the Pakistani line.The Haqqanis have also faced opposition from some Punjabi Taliban groups that were initially hosted and feted by them but have now sunk their own roots in the area and consider the Haqqanis to be as foreign to Waziristan as they are themselves.Analysts feel 10 years after it was created, the Waziristan sanctuary is readying for change, with dozens of groups realigning amid shifts in relations and tactical priorities concerning Afghanistan, Pakistan and India.For a while, there may be no clear friends or enemies in the area, they say.",

In a tweet he warned of \"a grave humanitarian mistake\" in which hundreds of thousands of people could be killed. Syrian government forces are said to be preparing a huge offensive on the last major rebel stronghold in the country. The UN says such a campaign could have disastrous consequences for thousands of civilians.The US State Department also warned on Monday that Washington would respond to any chemical attacks by the Syrian government or its allies.President Bashar al-Assad of Syria must not recklessly attack Idlib Province. The Russians and Iranians would be making a grave humanitarian mistake to take part in this potential human tragedy. Hundreds of thousands of people could be killed. Don’t let that happen!End of Twitter post  by @realDonaldTrumpUS ambassador to the UN Nikki Haley tweeted: \"All eyes on the actions of Assad, Russia, and Iran in Idlib. #NoChemicalWeapons\"With rebels defeated in most of Syria, the offensive in the northern province could prove to be the last major battle of the Syrian civil war.According to a UN estimate, there are about 10,000 al-Nusra and al-Qaeda jihadist fighters still holding out in Idlib.Sources quoted by Reuters news agency said that President Bashar al-Assad was preparing a phased offensive.Russian Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov has said \"terrorists\" must be wiped out in Idlib, accusing them of using civilians as human shields.Both he and his Syrian counterpart, Walid Muallem, have accused rebels of preparing to stage a chemical attack in Idlib in order to blame pro-government forces and draw new US military retaliation.Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov has said that recent naval drills off Syria were justified, adding that the \"hotbed of terrorists\" in Idlib must be tackled.UN envoy to Syria Staffan de Mistura has warned of a \"perfect storm\" if the government goes ahead with its threatened offensive in Idlib.He called for humanitarian corridors to be set up to allow civilians to be evacuated temporarily.The jihadists must be defeated, Mr de Mistura said, but not at the expense of thousands of civilian lives.\"There is a perfect storm based on warnings, counter-warnings which is gathering around and due to the dilemma, which is a true dilemma on how to defeat terrorists in Idlib and at the same time avoid affecting a huge number of civilians,\" he said.\"So, while we are aware that efforts and discussions are taking place to avoid the worst-case scenario, one cannot ignore that miscalculations may indeed occur leading to unforeseen escalation and we are all very much concerned.\"The UN is desperate to avoid the deaths of civilians seen recently in other parts of Syria such as Aleppo, Raqqa or the Eastern Ghouta, and its diplomats are appealing for all sides to show restraint.Mr de Mistura offered to go to Idlib personally to set up a humanitarian corridor which, he acknowledged, would mean evacuating people into government-controlled territory.After more than seven years of fighting, more than 400,000 people are dead or missing, and more than half the population have been driven out of their homes.Idlib has been a haven for rebels and their families evacuated out of areas won back by the government, but there is no obvious place for them to move to within Syria if they abandon the province now.Any offensive on Idlib could raise tensions with Turkey, which maintains observation posts around rebel territory as part of a \"de-escalation deal\" with Russia and Iran.Iran is to host a summit on Friday at which the leaders of Iran, Russia and Turkey will discuss Idlib, Fars news agency reported.",

            "title": "Why is there a war in Syria?",
            "content": "A peaceful uprising against the president of Syria seven years ago has turned into a full-scale civil war. The conflict has left more than 350,000 people dead, devastated cities and drawn in other countries. Even before the conflict began, many Syrians were complaining about high unemployment, corruption and a lack of political freedom under President Bashar al-Assad, who succeeded his late father Hafez in 2000.In March 2011, pro-democracy demonstrations erupted in the southern city of Deraa, inspired by the \"Arab Spring\" in neighbouring countries. When the government used deadly force to crush the dissent, protests demanding the president's resignation erupted nationwide.The unrest spread and the crackdown intensified. Opposition supporters took up arms, first to defend themselves and later to rid their areas of security forces. Mr Assad vowed to crush what he called \"foreign-backed terrorism\".The violence rapidly escalated and the country descended into civil war.The Syrian Observatory for Human Rights, a UK-based monitoring group with a network of sources on the ground, had documented the deaths of 353,900 people by March 2018, including 106,000 civilians. The figure did not include 56,900 people who it said were missing and presumed dead. The group also estimated 100,000 deaths had not been documented.Meanwhile, the Violations Documentation Center, which relies on activists inside Syria, has recorded what it considers violations of international humanitarian law and human rights law, including attacks on civilians. It had documented 185,980 battle-related deaths, including 119,200 civilians, by February 2018.It is now more than a battle between those for or against Mr Assad.Many groups and countries - each with their own agendas - are involved, making the situation far more complex and prolonging the fighting.They have been accused of fostering hatred between Syria's religious groups, pitching the Sunni Muslim majority against the president's Shia Alawite sect.Such divisions have led both sides to commit atrocities, torn communities apart and dimmed hopes of peace. They have also allowed the jihadist groups Islamic State (IS) and al-Qaeda to flourish.Syria's Kurds, who want the right of self-government but have not fought Mr Assad's forces, have added another dimension to the conflict.The government's key supporters are Russia and Iran, while the US, Turkey and Saudi Arabia back the rebels.Russia - which already had military bases in Syria - launched an air campaign in support of Mr Assad in 2015 that has been crucial in turning the tide of the war in the government's favour. The Russian military says its strikes only target \"terrorists\" but activists say they regularly kill mainstream rebels and civilians.   Iran is believed to have deployed hundreds of troops and spent billions of dollars to help Mr Assad. Thousands of Shia Muslim militiamen armed, trained and financed by Iran - mostly from Lebanon's Hezbollah movement, but also Iraq, Afghanistan and Yemen - have also fought alongside the Syrian army. The US, UK, France and other Western countries have provided varying degrees of support for what they consider \"moderate\" rebels.A global coalition they lead has also carried out air strikes on IS militants in Syria since 2014 and helped an alliance of Kurdish and Arab militias called the Syrian Democratic Forces (SDF) capture territory from the jihadists.Turkey has long supported the rebels but it has focused on using them to contain the Kurdish militia that dominates the SDF, accusing it of being an extension of a banned Kurdish rebel group in Turkey.Saudi Arabia, which is keen to counter Iranian influence, has also armed and financed the rebels.Israel, meanwhile, has been so concerned by shipments of Iranian weapons to Hezbollah in Syria that it has conducted air strikes in an attempt to thwart them.As well as causing hundreds of thousands of deaths, the war has left 1.5 million people with permanent disabilities, including 86,000 who have lost limbs.At least 6.1 million Syrians are internally displaced, while another 5.6 million have fled abroad.Neighbouring Lebanon, Jordan and Turkey, where 92% of them now live, have struggled to cope with one of the largest refugee exoduses in recent history.The UN estimates 13.1 million people will require some form of humanitarian help in Syria in 2018.The warring parties have made the problems worse by refusing aid agencies access to many of those in need. Almost 3 million people live in besieged or hard-to-reach areas.Syrians also have limited access to healthcare. Physicians for Human Rights had documented 492 attacks on 330 medical facilities by the end of December 2017, resulting in the deaths of 847 medical personnel.Much of Syria's rich cultural heritage has also been destroyed. All six of the country's six Unesco World Heritage sites have been damaged significantly. Entire neighbourhoods have been levelled across the country. A recent UN assessment found 93% of buildings had been damaged or destroyed in one district of the rebel-held Eastern Ghouta region near Damascus. The government has regained control of Syria's biggest cities but large parts of the country are still held by rebel groups and the Kurdish-led SDF alliance.The largest opposition stronghold is the north-western province of Idlib, home to more than 2.6 million people.Despite being designated a \"de-escalation zone\", Idlib is the target of an offensive by the government, which says it is targeting jihadists linked to al-Qaeda.A ground assault is also under way in the Eastern Ghouta. Its 393,000 residents have been under siege by the government since 2013, and are facing intense bombardment as well as severe shortages of food and medical supplies.The SDF meanwhile controls most territory east of the River Euphrates, including the city of Raqqa. Until 2017, it was the de facto capital of the \"caliphate\" proclaimed by IS, which now controls only a few pockets across Syria.It does not look like it will any time soon but everyone agrees a political solution is required. The UN Security Council has called for the implementation of the 2012 Geneva Communique, which envisages a transitional governing body \"formed on the basis of mutual consent.\" But nine rounds of UN-mediated peace talks - known as the Geneva II process - since 2014 have shown little progress.President Assad has appeared increasingly unwilling to negotiate with the opposition. The rebels still insist he must step down as part of any settlement.Meanwhile, Western powers have accused Russia of undermining the peace talks by setting up a parallel political process.

            "title": "Tortured and killed: Kashmir's vulnerable policemen",
            "content": "At least 31 policemen in Indian-administered Kashmir have been killed by militants this year, according to official estimates. Sameer Yasir reports on how the state's police force is bearing the brunt of the insurgency.Mohammad Ashraf Dar was killed in his kitchen in front of his one-year-old daughter on 22 August. It was the day of Eid-ul-Adha, a holy Muslim festival. The 45-year-old sub-inspector was posted to central Kashmir but he had come home to spend the holiday with his wife and three children.His family lives in the tiny village of Larve, surrounded by paddy fields and apple orchards, in southern Kashmir's Pulwama district. The region has witnessed a fresh spiral of deadly violence, sparked by the killing of a popular militant leader, Burhan Wani, in July 2016 by Indian security forces. And policemen, many of them local Muslims, have become the most vulnerable targets as violence escalates in the region. In recent months, they have even been advised to avoid visiting their homes. If they do, they should take \"extreme precautions\", particularly in the southern region, said the Director General of Jammu and Kashmir Police, Shesh Paul Vaid.  Dar's colleagues said he was asked by his friends and family to stay away from home but he had said he had no need to hide. \"Am I a thief? I have never wronged anyone,\" he had said. \"The life of a local policeman fighting a homegrown insurgency is like walking on a road filled with landmines,\" said Ghulam Qadirm, Dar's father.Muslim separatists have waged a violent campaign against Indian rule in Muslim-majority Kashmir since 1989. The region remains a subject of bitter dispute between India and Pakistan, who have fought two out of three wars over it. India has long accused Pakistan of fuelling the unrest, a charge Islamabad denies. The insurgency, which had begun to wane since the late 1990s, intensified in 2016 after Wani's death. When Kashmiris took to the streets to protest, security forces used \"pellet guns\", a kind of shotgun, against them. Indian forces had said that the pellets, made of rubber-encased steel, were not lethal but they killed dozens of people and injured more than 1,500 others, blinding hundreds of bystanders including children who were caught in the crossfire. Since then, the number of militants being killed has also shot up. In 2017 alone, 76 militants were killed - the highest in a decade - according to police. And this year, 66 were killed only in south Kashmir. For decades, the Indian government did not deploy policemen in their own towns or neighbourhoods in Kashmir in order to protect their identities and their families. But in the restive south - in districts such as Pulwama - as more local youth join the insurgency, the attacks on policemen have grown.No militant group has recently said it killed any policeman, even in Dar's case, which was a high-profile killing.Unofficially, police blame militant groups like Hizbul Mujahideen and Lashkar-e-taiba for such attacks. The men who killed Dar knew where he lived. They crept into his house -  their faces masked, carrying rucksacks and rifles slung over their shoulders - while he offered his evening prayers at the local mosque. \"Keep your mouth shut,\" they told Dar's wife, Shehla Gani, as they pointed a gun at her. They pushed her and her two sons, Jibran Ashraf, 12, and Mohammad Owaim, 7, into a corner. \"They pulled my hand and asked me where my father was,\" Jibran recalled.  When Dar returned home, his one-year-old daughter, Iraj, was with him. But the masked men forced him into the kitchen while he still held her in his arms. He refused to let her go but they hit him and snatched her.  \"You are like my brothers,\" Dar said to the men. \"I have never harmed anyone.\"Ms Gani, who could hear everything from the next room, says she then heard a volley of shots. Dar died on the spot. \"My daughter's innocent eyes saw it all,\" Ms Gani said.\"Is a policeman not Kashmiri?\" asked Abdul Gani Shah, 68, a resident of Mutalhama village in south Kashmir. \"By targeting policemen, militants are hurting their cause.\" In another incident in June 2017, Muhammad Ayub, a police officer in plainclothes, was lynched in the capital Srinagar. He had allegedly fired his gun into a crowd after getting into a brawl with some youths.In July 2018, constable Mohammad Saleem Shah went missing while he was on a fishing expedition with friends. His bullet-riddled body was found the next day in an apple orchard. Officials said at least 12 family members of policemen were kidnapped this year. On 28 August, suspected militants abducted the son of a policeman from his home in south Kashmir. The police traced the kidnapping to Riyaz Naiko, chief of the Hizbul Mujahideen militant group. Naiko had once threatened Kashmiri policemen to \"leave their jobs or face consequences\". Muhammad Aslam Chowdhary, a senior police officer, said he felt he was a target not just on the streets when he was in uniform but even inside the four walls of his home. Until recently, he was posted in Pulwama.  \"Sometime you even doubt your own family members,\" he added. Despite all this, many young Kashmiris want to join the police force. There aren't many jobs in the region because of sporadic violence and a weak economy.  \"I would like to join the police because I have to take care of my parents,\" said Furkan Ahmad, who is currently training to be a police officer. Meanwhile, the rift between Kashmiris and the police continues to widen. Protesters clashed with police in June after a demonstrator run over by a police jeep died in hospital. Police said they were defending themselves but locals alleged that they had deliberately driven into the crowd.\"Humanity is dead,\" said Mr Qadrim. \"It's been dead in Kashmir for a long time.\"",

            "title": "Dozens of elephants killed near Botswana wildlife sanctuary",
            "content": "Carcases of nearly 90 elephants have been found near a famous wildlife sanctuary in Botswana, conservationists say.Elephants Without Borders, which is conducting an aerial survey, said the scale of poaching deaths is the largest seen in Africa. The spike coincides with Botswana's anti-poaching unit being disarmed.Botswana has the world's largest elephant population, but poachers have been breaching its border.Some readers may find the image below distressingThe scientist carrying out the extensive wildlife survey said many of the 87 dead elephants were killed for their tusks just weeks ago - and that five white rhinos have been poached in three months. \"I'm shocked, I'm completely astounded. The scale of elephant poaching is by far the largest I've seen or read about anywhere in Africa to date,\" said Dr Mike Chase from Elephants Without Borders.\"When I compare this to figures and data from the Great Elephant Census, which I conducted in 2015, we are recording double the number of fresh poached elephants than anywhere else in Africa.\"That census estimated a third of Africa's elephants had been killed in the last decade and 60% of Tanzania's elephants had been lost in five years.Botswana has had a reputation for an unforgiving approach to poachers and had largely escaped the elephant losses seen elsewhere.Despite a lack of fences on the international border, data from tracking collars showed elephants retreating from Angola, Namibia and Zambia and deciding to stay within the boundaries of Botswana where it was thought to be safe.Incidents of poaching in the country were rare because of armed and well-managed anti-poaching units.With 130,000 elephants, Botswana has been described as their last sanctuary in Africa as poaching for ivory continues to wipe out herds across the rest of the continent.The first sign that was changing came two years ago when the BBC flew with Mr Chase close to the Namibian border and he discovered a string of elephant carcasses with their tusks removed for the first time.Watch: Findings from the last Elephant censusBut these latest killings have been found deep in Botswana - close to the protected Okavango Delta wildlife sanctuary, which attracts tourists from around the world.\"People did warn us of an impending poaching problem and we thought we were prepared for it,\" said Mr Chase, who pointed to the disarmament of the country's anti-poaching unit as a cause.\"The poachers are now turning their guns to Botswana. We have the world's largest elephant population and it's open season for poachers.\"Clearly we need to be doing more to stop the scale of what we are recording on our survey.\"The government disarmed its anti-poaching units in May - a month after President Mokgweetsi Masisi was sworn into office.The units have focussed much of their effort on the border regions, which have historically been more vulnerable.A senior official in the president's office, Carter Morupisi, told journalists in Botswana at the time that the \"government has decided to withdraw military weapons and equipment from the Department of Wildlife and National Parks\", but he did not explain why.Botswana's 2018 Wildlife Aerial Survey is only half-way through and conservationists fear the final figure of poached elephants will be a lot higher.The survey area is split into sections, or transepts, and the plane flies back and forth like a lawnmower cutting the grass - turning at each end to ensure nothing is missed. \"Fresh carcasses\" are those lost within the last three months, but many of those recorded had been killed within the last few weeks.Conservationists fear the scale of this new poaching problem is being ignored as it is bad for the country's reputation.\"This requires urgent and immediate action by the Botswana government,\" said Mr Chase. \"Botswana has always been at the forefront of conservation and it will require political will.\"Our new president must uphold Botswana's legacy and tackle this problem quickly. Tourism is vitally important for our economy, jobs, as well as our international reputation, which is at stake here as being a safe stronghold for elephants.\"",

            "content": "Migrants and asylum seekers crossing the Mediterranean now face an even deadlier journey then they have in the past, the UN refugee agency has warned. In a report, the agency says that while the number of people arriving in Europe has fallen significantly, the number of deaths has risen sharply. Traffickers are having to take greater risks as there is more surveillance from the Libyan coastguard, it says.More than 1,600 people have died trying to reach Europe so far this year.In the central Mediterranean, one person died or went missing for every 18 people who crossed to Europe between January and July 2018, compared to one death for every 42 people who crossed in the same period in 2017, the report said.Seven of those incidents have been since June alone, the UNHCR said.As the number of those trying to cross falls, Europe should focus less on managing numbers and instead on saving lives, the agency says in its report.On the central Mediterranean route (from northern Africa to southern Europe) so far this year, there have been 10 separate incidents in which 50 or more people died - most after departing from Libya. Libya's coastguard intercepts more and more boats carrying migrants, increasing the likelihood that those on board may die during the Mediterranean journeys, the UN refugee agency says.\"The reason the traffic has become more deadly is that the traffickers are taking more risk, because there is more surveillance exercised by the Libyan coastguards,\" said Vincent Cochetel, UNHCR's special envoy for the central Mediterranean. \"They are trying to cut the costs: it costs them more to keep those people here longer in their warehouses, under captivity.\"Matt Saltmarsh from the agency said much more needed to be done.\"We are calling for the European authorities in particular to come up with a co-ordinated strategy whereby boats can be systematically disembarked in different parts of Europe and where asylum claiming conditions and reception centres are in place ready to receive those people who arrive,\" he told the BBC.The EU has stepped up co-operation with the Libyan coastguard to intercept migrant boats. But people-smuggling gangs have flourished in Libya's chaos, charging desperate migrants thousands of dollars per head.The EU Commission has proposed \"regional disembarkation platforms\" in North Africa, where the UN and other agencies could screen those who have a genuine claim to asylum in Europe. Those not eligible would be offered help to resettle in their home countries.But processing centres outside the EU must not become a \"Guantanamo Bay\" for migrants, EU Migration Commissioner Dimitris Avramopoulos warned.The EU also aims to beef up its Frontex border guard force to 10,000 staff by the end of 2020.",

            "content": "A number of Dublin city councillors are attempting to stop the sale of a Magdalene Laundry building to a hotel chain.The Magdalene Laundries were Catholic-run workhouses for so called \"fallen women\", unmarried mothers, and orphans.If approved the complex is to be sold by the council for €14m (£12.5m) to the Japanese company, Toyoko Limited.The council said it is for councillors to decide whether to go ahead with the sale.Dublin city council took control of the property in a transfer of land between the council and the Sisters of Charity religious order after the laundry closed 22 years ago.Social Democrat councillor Gary Gannon is calling for members to support a bid to prevent the sale.The motion was discussed at a Dublin city council meeting on Monday afternoon. It received support from Sinn Féin, Labour, the Workers Party as well as some Independent councillors.However, Fine Gael councillor Ray McAdam said Mr Gannon's motion was \"pre-emptive\" as the council was still waiting for the Lord Mayor's working group on the issue to make its report.The vote on whether to halt the sale of the former Magdalene Laundry has been adjourned to 13 September as the councillors ran out of time.Mr Gannon said the property should be used to fulfil the government's commitment to have a memorial for the women who were placed in the laundries.In February 2013, then Taoiseach (prime minister) Enda Kenny apologised to the 10,000 women who had passed through the laundries.Following that, Justice John Quirke recommended the establishment of a redress scheme for the Magdalene survivors.Mr Justice Quirke also recommended the establishment of a memorial garden or museum.The recommendations were accepted by the government in full and while a redress scheme was opened in June 2013, there has yet to be an official permanent memorial. • Originally termed Magdalene Asylums, the first in Ireland was opened in Dublin in 1765, for Protestant girls• First Catholic home was founded in Cork in 1809• Envisaged as short-term refuges for \"fallen women\" they became long-term institutions and penitents were required to work, mostly in laundries on the premises• They extended to take in unmarried mothers, women with learning difficulties and girls who had been abused• Between 1922 and 1996 there were 10 such laundries in the Republic of Ireland• The women worked behind locked doors unable to leave after being admitted and while the laundries were paid, they received no wages• The congregations that ran them were the Sisters of Our Lady of Charity, the Congregation of the Sisters of Mercy, the Religious Sisters of Charity and the Sisters of the Good ShepherdMr Gannon said: \"It is only in the last couple of years that we started to develop an understanding of institutional abuse.\"That laundry on Sean McDermott Street is the only one still in state possession, and there is a growing movement that says we need some sort of museum or commemorative centre that can help us understand that particular issue. \"The survivors are all in favour of having a memorial to their suffering, that was a request that was made by the survivors, it is something all survivor groups have been really passionate about,\" he added.",

            "content": "A Russian whose love of the Beatles led him to turn his flat into a \"Fab Four\" museum has died in St Petersburg. Russians knew Kolya Vasin as the Beatles' biggest fan during Soviet times, when the communist authorities saw Western rock music as subversive.Vasin, who died aged 73, began collecting Beatles albums and memorabilia in the 1960s. He treasured a record - Live Peace in Toronto 1969 - signed by John Lennon and Yoko Ono. The Beatles had many fans in the USSR.On Facebook one of Vasin's friends, Nick Barabanov, wrote that Nikolai (Kolya) Vasin had \"gone to join John Lennon and George Harrison. May they have a happy and bright time there!\"He died in a fall at a St Petersburg shopping centre on 29 August.For more than 50 years the Beatles dominated Vasin's life. He dreamed of dedicating a \"shrine of love\" in St Petersburg to John Lennon but the project was never realised, even though city officials found a suitable site for it. Many fans supported the shrine idea. When asked why he had allowed the Beatles to take over his life he replied that having children would not have equalled the joy and love that the Liverpool band had given him.A leading Russian cultural commentator, Artemy Troitsky, says the impact of the Beatles songs behind the Iron Curtain was profound. \"The Beatles turned tens of millions of Soviet youngsters to another religion,\" he told the BBC. 29 Августа мой друг Коля Васин ушёл к Джону Леннону и Джорджу Харрисону.\nПусть им там будет хорошо и светло!End of Facebook post  by NickAlexander Kan, a BBC Russian Service analyst, wrote in a tribute that Vasin was legendary among Russian rock fans. He met Vasin in 1980, by which time Kan himself was enthusiastic about other bands besides the Beatles, \"but for him there was nothing more important\". Vasin described as divine intervention the fact that John Lennon had sent him the signed album. In 1970 he had sent a birthday greetings telegram to Lennon and miraculously the Beatles legend had picked it out of his pile of fan mail from around the world.Vasin influenced many other Russians with his passion for the Beatles and wrote a book about the band's cultural impact behind the Iron Curtain. The book's title - Rock on the Russian Bones - referred to Soviet fans' use of old X-ray plates for inscribing bootleg recordings of Beatles tracks. Western rock albums were nearly all banned by the authorities but there was a vast black market of bootleg recordings among youngsters in the Soviet bloc.Once communist-era censorship had disappeared Vasin staged parties every year to mark the birthdays of each of the Beatles.",

            "content": "China does not invest in \"vanity projects\" in Africa and is helping the continent build its infrastructure, President Xi Jinping has said. He pledged an extra $60bn (£42bn) for the continent's development, as he opened a summit with African leaders in Beijing to boost relations. China is the single largest bilateral financier of infrastructure in Africa. But critics warn that African nations have been going into unsustainable levels of debt with the Asian giant. Mr Xi admitted there was a need to look at the commercial viability of some projects and make co-operation more viable.\"China's co-operation with Africa is clearly targeted at the major bottlenecks to development,\" he told business leaders ahead of the opening of the two-day summit. \"Resources for our co-operation are not to be spent on any vanity projects but in places where they count the most.\"South Africa's President Cyril Ramaphosa welcomed China's growing involvement on the continent, saying he did not agree that a \"new colonialism is taking hold  in Africa as our detractors would have us believe\".All African nations are represented at the summit, except for the tiny kingdom of eSwatini, formerly known as Swaziland. It is the only African state to maintain diplomatic ties with Taiwan. China's government does not allow countries to have official ties with both itself and Taiwan, which Beijing considers its own territory.Addressing leaders in Beijing's Great Hall of the People, Mr Xi said the $60bn would be made up of both aid and loans. It would be spent on eight initiatives over the next three years, including building more infrastructure and giving scholarships to young Africans, he said.\"China's investment in Africa comes with no political strings attached,\" Mr Xi added.The $60bn pledge is over and above the $60bn China offered to Africa at a similar summit in 2015 in South Africa's main city, Johannesburg.Debt from China's interest-free loans, due by the end of 2018, would be written off for some poor African states, Mr Xi said. China would also set up a peace and security fund and would continue to provide free military assistance to the African Union, he added.China lent around $125bn to Africa between 2000 and 2016, according to data compiled by the China-Africa Research Initiative at Washington's Johns Hopkins University School of Advanced International Studies.It has spent heavily on roads, railways, ports and other major infrastructure projects.This includes a $3.2bn railway line between Kenya's capital, Nairobi, and the port city of Mombasa.It is supposed to eventually connect landlocked South Sudan, eastern Democratic Republic of Congo, Rwanda, Burundi and Ethiopia to the Indian Ocean.But the project has been marred by corruption allegations, and claims by economists that the cost was too high.It ran up a loss of about $100m in its first year of operation, official figures show.",

            "title": "Can Chinese migrants integrate in Africa?",
            "content": "She may be the only Chinese student on campus, but Lu Cheng has her feet firmly planted in two camps.Most of her friends at her business college in Lusaka are from Zambia. Perched on a bench in the college grounds, she plays the guitar with her friends. At home her instrument of choice is the guzheng, a Chinese harp.But for an older generation of Chinese migrant, the ease of transitioning between cultures is a lot harder. It's been seven years since Lu Cheng's parents waved goodbye to China and headed west to find better business opportunities. They now run a successful chicken feed factory, and although her father Lu Jin says he has made a few Zambian friends, he relies largely on his wife and daughter for company.Lu Cheng confides that her parents are counting the days until she graduates, when they will have \"done their duty\" and can return \"home\" to retire. Compared to her friends' parents, they're far \"more traditional\", she says.Much of the sense of isolation and disconnection among the older Chinese across Africa seems to stem from the challenge of language. Thirty-five years ago, English teachers were hard to come by in China. The legacy is a generation of Chinese nationals, thousands of miles from home, who rely on their own expat community for support. But as new generations arrive, things do appear to be changing.Huang Hongxiang works at China House, a consultancy based in Kenya which tries to build ties between the African and Chinese business communities. He admits that the Chinese who came to the continent over the past 20 years - working for big Chinese state corporations - gained a reputation for keeping themselves to themselves and of being aloof, tough on employees and even a little bit distant.  More on China in Africa:The BBC is running a special series about China's role in Africa linked to the China-Africa summit on 4-5 December in South Africa.But there's an explanation for this, he says. They didn't know how to manage local workers and struggled to communicate - so their default position was to retreat into their own community. But younger Chinese are arriving with \"more international experience\" and with a different view of the continent. I found one factory worker nicknamed \"Cherry\" who had worked and studied in Switzerland, the UK and Madagascar before arriving to take up a post at a Chinese furniture firm in Kenya. The transition has been \"pretty easy\", she says. China has more in common with many African countries than many people think. Hongxiang says that younger Chinese still retain the business instinct of their parents' generation but \"understand that the more you integrate, the more you get to know your market and see business opportunities\". But it's not only about cold, hard commerce - they also want to make friends.It would be naive to gloss over the fact that like other countries, Zambia at times has had a strained relationship with its Chinese partners, especially in the rich copper belt in the north of the country. There have been demonstrations challenging what Zambians see as the negligent approach to safety. Just a week before I visited, three Chinese nationals from the same family were murdered in the town of Kitwe in the north.Deep historical ties bind the two countries and their communities together. It was back in the 1970s under President Kenneth Kaunda that the relationship with China began to take shape. Zambia turned to China to help build the railways to export the copper from Zambian mines out through Tanzania when Zimbabwe was no longer an option. Geoffrey Sakulande from Zambia's Chamber of Commerce believes that relationship is growing warmer and stronger by the day. Not simply because of better transport, communication and the internet but because a younger generation of Chinese migrant is now having a stronger personal stake in the country.",

            "title": "Putin cast as national saviour ahead of Russia election",
            "content": "Long presented as the bare-chested, macho leader who defends Russia against the West, President Vladimir Putin now has a rather more mystical image in state media.With elections looming in March, leading state-controlled TV channels are roping in religion to cast him as a national saviour who healed Russia's historical divisions and rescued the nation from chaos.The main vehicle is a recent documentary on top national channel Rossiya 1 about a monastery widely thought to be Mr Putin's favourite - Valaam, on a remote archipelago in northern Lake Ladoga.Closed under Soviet rule and almost completely ruined by years of neglect, Valaam has been rebuilt since the collapse of the USSR, with - as the film implies - vital support from Mr Putin.Valaam is repeatedly described as the \"mirror of Russia\". Its recovery from the ruin inflicted after World War Two is meant to be a metaphor for the country's own journey under Mr Putin.\"Valaam died when the great Russian state was destroyed,\" the presenter says. \"It was restored, and our state again rose up from its knees,\" he adds, over video of Mr Putin visiting the monastery.The president's first-ever visit to the archipelago is described almost like a mythical event.\"This is where a boat docked, from which Vladimir Putin emerged,\" says the voice-over to rousing music.The monastery's head, Bishop Pankraty, recounts how a holidaying pensioner there at the time \"rubbed her eyes to see it wasn't a hallucination, a mirage\", and how Mr Putin later that day promised to help restore a ruined hermitage he spotted in the woods.The message, constantly repeated, is the contrast between the monastery's former dilapidated and vandalised state and its current splendour - a revival likened to that of Russia from the perceived chaos and national humiliation of the 1990s.Another recurring theme is that Mr Putin has led Russia back to faith since the Soviet era's militant atheism, while also healing the rift between those who pine for the USSR's great-power status and those who hark back to Russia's pre-revolutionary imperial and Orthodox traditions.In the film, Mr Putin argues that the seeds of reconciliation were there even in the darkest days, because Soviet troops gave the monks time to collect the monastery's relics before evicting them during World War Two.He then argues that communism and Christianity are essentially the same idea, and compares the mausoleum of Bolshevik revolutionary leader Vladimir Lenin to the Christian tradition of church relics.You might also like:Similar themes - Mr Putin as the saviour and unity between the Soviet and pre-revolutionary traditions - were prominent in another documentary on state TV, and in even more mystical terms.Fronted by veteran ultranationalist Alexander Prokhanov, the five-episode epic was broadcast on the state rolling-news channel Rossiya 24 over Russia's long New Year holiday.Its core argument was that the state is the sacred centre of Russian life, the subject of periodic catastrophes throughout history, before each time being rescued and revived in new glory by divine intervention.After the October Revolution destroyed the Russian Empire, the conduit for this miracle was Joseph Stalin, who created a new, glorious Red Empire, according to Prokhanov. That mythology glosses over Stalin's gross human rights abuses.After the next perceived disaster - the collapse of the Soviet Union - the saviour was Vladimir Putin, Prokhanov argues, adding that the result is the latest Russian golden age - the \"Fifth Empire\".With only two months to go until the 18 March presidential election, all this feels like part of the Kremlin's opening salvoes in Mr Putin's campaign to win a fourth six-year term.It is perhaps no coincidence that the Valaam documentary was made and presented by Andrei Kondrashov, a prominent journalist recently appointed as Mr Putin's campaign spokesman.Despite protests against corruption last year and anecdotal evidence of growing discontent at falling living standards, the narrative of a glorious national revival still appears to be working with many Russians, with official polls putting Mr Putin's support at around 80%.But the Kremlin still seems to be nervous. The man widely seen as Mr Putin's most potent challenger, protest leader and anti-corruption campaigner Alexei Navalny, has been barred from standing, over a criminal conviction that many see as a political manoeuvre.BBC Monitoring reports and analyses news from TV, radio, web and print media around the world.

            "title": "Kem Sokha: Jailed for standing up to Cambodia's strongman",
            "content": "The Cambodian ruling party's landslide win in recent elections came as little surprise - the widespread jailing of rivals meant there was almost no political opposition left. The most prominent of them remains in prison, with no immediate prospect of release, as George Wright reports. In the early hours of Sunday 3 September last year, Kem Monovithya, a politician and daughter of opposition leader Kem Sokha, received a call from her parents - armed police were attempting to break into their family home in the capital Phnom Penh. \"My mum said there's more than 100 people trying to break into our house,\" Monovithya said in an interview last month. They had no warrant, but with their guards being held at gunpoint, her father decided it would be safer to open the door.\"He told me he had to get off the phone because 'they are going to handcuff me',\" she recalls.  Then the phone went dead. Kem Sokha was jailed and a year on, has never gone on trial. He remains in solitary confinement in a remote prison near the Vietnamese border. In the 2013 elections, Sokha and Sam Rainsy had brought their Cambodia National Rescue Party (CNRP) to within just seven seats of victory, despite accusations of vote-rigging and intimidation.Rainsy, a long-time foe of Prime Minister Hun Sen, has been living in Paris since 2015 to avoid jail over convictions widely branded as politically motivated.So as the next election approached, Sokha was the only viable threat to the prime minister's 33-year iron-fisted rule. Sokha was accused of plotting to wage a US-backed revolution. This was based upon a 2013 video where Sokha was seen telling an audience in Australia that he had been receiving political support and advice from the US. However, many saw it as a cynical move, aimed at securing victory for the ruling Cambodian People's Party (CPP).The CNRP was outlawed in November, allowing the CPP to win all 125 National Assembly seats on 29 July, making Cambodia a de facto one-party state.Sokha's arrest marked an alarming escalation in an already deteriorating political climate that had seen rights advocates, opposition supporters and critics jailed. On the day of his arrest, the Cambodia Daily published its last ever newspaper as it was shut down in a crackdown on independent media. It ran a front page headline \"Descent Into Outright Dictatorship\" above a photo of a startled Sokha in handcuffs.For the past year, the only people who have been allowed to visit Sokha are his wife, Te Chanmono, and lawyers. The government has rejected repeated requests for visits from international observers, UN officials, foreign diplomats and human rights officers.Sokha spends most of his days alone and prison guards generally do not converse with him, Monovithya says. Chanmono was only recently allowed to bring him books, mostly relating to Buddhist meditation, but he is still banned from using pens and pencils, she adds. One of Sokha's lawyers, Heng Pheng, who visits his client every few weeks, says he attempts to stay active and is allowed to grow vegetables but his moods are up and down, often due to his serious health problems. He currently is suffering from high blood pressure, severe pain in his shoulder and diabetes but is being denied surgery and other medical treatment. Monovithya says the family home in Phnom Penh is also under regular surveillance and her mother is \"completely traumatised\".\"I think it's more difficult on her psychologically than any of us.\"Hun Sen has been known to ramp up oppression during politically tense periods before relieving the pressure valve once he has stamped his authority once more.So with the election done and dusted, some observers were expecting Sokha to be released on bail. Almost all the other detained CNRP members were recently free but, last week, Phnom Penh Municipal Court extended Sokha's pre-trial detention for a further six months. This came a day after Hun Sen told around 10,000 garment workers that he would keep the opposition leader locked up, which appeared to once again contradict his claims that the country's judiciary is independent. Astrid Noren-Nilsson, an associate senior lecturer at Sweden's Lund University specialising in Cambodian politics, says the decision to keep Sokha locked up illustrates that the ruling party will not be relaxing its heavy-handed approach to the CNRP.\"The election marks a transition to a new, one-party order, and the government needs to establish the 'new normal',\" she argues.She says the international community could press for Sokha's release by making credible threats to Cambodia's economy. Cambodia generated more than $7bn (£5.4bn) from exporting garment and footwear products last year. The main importer is the EU, which allows Cambodia duty-free access under the Everything But Arms agreement, on the condition that democratic and human rights standards are met.The EU has said it could consider taking action against Cambodia if the political situation does not improve. While there was never much hope that the CNRP could contest the election, she says, \"the release of Kem Sokha could be a minor enough concession\".Government spokesman Phay Siphan denied any suggestion that Kem Sokha was being held as a political prisoner, insisting he was guilty of treason.He dismissed claims the government could be pressured into releasing Sokha by threats of sanctions or the potential removal of its preferential trade access for garment exports.\"EBA is completely different and cannot interfere with the court's decision,\" he said. \"Let the court do their own process.\"Monovithya says that she believes her father would not turn his back on politics or go into exile if released, like Sam Rainsy and most senior opposition figures. Until then, she says, she has no hope of him being released on humanitarian grounds. \"I don't think [Hun Sen] would release him just because he's in power and the election is done, because obviously this is not a decent person.\"She believes the only chance of her father being released is if his detention becomes a genuine burden to Cambodia's long-serving strongman: \"If there's no cost of keeping him he will continue to keep him.\"George Wright is a freelance reporter based in Phnom Penh",

            "title": "NFL protests: Why did players kneel or link arms?",
            "content": "US football coaches and players across the country entered the political arena over the weekend by taking a stand against President Donald Trump. The president provoked outrage in the National Football League (NFL) after he suggested players who failed to stand during the US anthem should be sacked. Several football teams were seen linking arms or opted to remain in the locker room as the anthem played. Others knelt in protest against racial injustice and police brutality.But what do the various forms of protest mean? Former San Francisco 49ers quarterback Colin Kaepernick started the protest when he sat down as the Star-Spangled Banner played during a pre-season game in 2016.He explained his gesture, which later became taking a knee, was meant to highlight racial injustice and police brutality against African Americans. Some commentators suggest Mr Kaepernick, who remains unsigned this season, was blacklisted from the sport for his demonstrations. Angered by Mr Trump's comments over the weekend, dozens of players followed Mr Kaepernick's example.Nearly two dozen members of the Jacksonville Jaguars and Baltimore Ravens took a knee on Sunday at a game in London while nearly all of the Oakland Raiders were seen kneeling or sitting at a game against the Washington Redskins. Miami Dolphin players on Sunday wore shirts emblazoned with the phrase: \"#ImWithKap\" during pre-game warm-ups. Dolphin Julius Thomas, who previously stood during the anthem, said he wanted to send a message that he did not condone what he sees as Mr Trump's intimidation tactics. \"I'm not OK with somebody trying to prevent someone from standing up for what they think is important,\" he said. Several players and coaches suggested they locked arms to show team unity in the wake of Mr Trump's comments. Philadelphia Eagles player Malcolm Jenkins urged fans in a tweet before the game to join the team in locking arms to show unity. In a rare appearance on field, Jaguars owner Shahid Khan was seen entwined with his team's players while Ravens Coach John Harbaugh was also spotted linking arms with players. Mr Khan, a Pakistani-American and Republican who has contributed to Mr Trump's inauguration, said in a statement he stood with the players to express his support for them \"following the divisive and contentions remarks made by President Trump, and was honoured to be arm in arm with them\". He added that \"we can and should be united in the effort to become better as people and a nation\".The Pittsburgh Steelers were nowhere to be seen as the anthem began to play at Soldier Field before their game against the Chicago Bears. Some suggested it was an attempt to avoid the political row altogether, but Pittsburgh quarterback Ben Roethlisberger explained to ESPN that his team decided to stay in the locker room during the anthem as a symbol of solidarity. \"By no means, by no way shape or form, was there any disrespect intended towards our troops and those who serve this country,\" he told ESPN, adding the team has \"the utmost respect for them\". \"We decided we were going to talk about what we were going to do because we knew some guys wanted to take a knee, guys wanted to stand. We said whatever we do, we need to make sure we are unified as one group because that is what we are about and that is what it should be about,\" he added. \"Staying together as one unit, one group, one brotherhood, things like that.\"Seattle Seahawks and Tennessee Titans players also opted to remain inside before their games and released similar statements. \"We will not stand for the injustice that has plagued people of color in this country,\" the Seahawks said in a statement.

            "content": "Ukraine's President Petro Poroshenko says top clerics in the Orthodox Church are now ready to grant independence to the Kiev Church, defying Moscow. If the Constantinople Patriarch, Bartholomew, grants Kiev autocephaly (independence) he will be recognising its split with the Moscow Patriarchate. On Friday Russia's Patriarch Kirill met Bartholomew in Istanbul. They did not resolve the Kiev Church's status.Russia sees Kiev as the historic cradle of the Russian Orthodox Church.Russian President Vladimir Putin, a staunch ally of Patriarch Kirill, is bitterly opposed to President Poroshenko. There is a tense standoff in eastern Ukraine between Ukrainian government troops and Russian-backed rebels.  In a tweet on Monday Mr Poroshenko said Bartholomew's Ecumenical Patriarchate had \"decided that, without taking account of Moscow's opinion, it can give all states the right to establish a local church. \"And first of all it is the right for Ukraine to set up a Local Congregation of the Ukrainian Orthodox Church.\"On Facebook a spokesman for the Kiev Patriarchate said the move to grant independence was going ahead.\"The Ecumenical Patriarch explained to the Russian delegation that the decision had been taken and that the relevant procedures were under way,\" Archbishop Yevstratiy Zorya wrote.Tensions within the Ukrainian Orthodox Church mounted after the collapse of the Soviet Union in 1991. Ukraine won independence, and with communism discredited there was a huge revival in Christian worship. For centuries, before the Soviet period, the Russian Orthodox Church had been identified with the Russian state, allying its interests with those of the tsar. The Russian nationalist revival under Boris Yeltsin, then under Vladimir Putin, boosted the Church's authority and determination to stay in charge of the Ukrainian churches. In the early Middle Ages Christianity spread to the rest of Russia from Kievan Rus, which was the origin of the Russian state.  Today there are three Orthodox Church branches based in Kiev: The branch loyal to Kirill remains the biggest, but a formal schism could lead many of its followers to join the Kiev Patriarchate.The Moscow Patriarchate's position is that the Ukrainian \"schismatics\" should repent and return to the Russian Orthodox fold.But there is also rivalry between Kirill's powerful Moscow Patriarchate - which has an estimated 150 million followers - and the Ecumenical Patriarchate under Bartholomew, who is seen as first among equals in the Eastern Orthodox Church.The rivalry has been there for centuries, dating back to the Byzantine and Russian empires. Ukraine was part of the Russian empire, but many of its worshippers looked to Constantinople (later Istanbul), rather than Moscow for spiritual guidance. Speaking after his talks in Istanbul, Patriarch Kirill said he and Patriarch Bartholomew had discussed \"all the problems on the agenda\" and it was \"a dialogue between two brothers\". \"There was nothing secret at the meeting, nothing that could sort of explode one's conscience,\" he said, without giving any specifics. Their talks lasted nearly three hours.",

            "title": "Dutch asylum row: Armenian children face expulsion",
            "content": "Two Armenian children who have spent most of their lives in the Netherlands face imminent deportation after emerging from hiding following a failed asylum plea.Howick, 13, and his sister Lily, 12, came to the Netherlands with their mother in 2008. Their mother was deported last year and the children's friends have rallied around them, calling for them to stay.However, the Dutch government insists its asylum policy is fair.Prime Minister Mark Rutte said last week he understood the emotion surrounding the case but asylum numbers had to be kept under control. \"Anyone who doesn't fall under the criteria cannot stay here,\" he said.Their mother, 37-year-old Armina Hambartsjumian, applied for asylum shortly after arriving in the Netherlands in 2008 from Russia. The children have never lived in Armenia and barely speak the language.When their mother was deported in 2017, she sent the children to a secret address before they were found by authorities. They have since been living with a family who had befriended their mother.For months, the courts considered the children's case, with campaigners arguing their mother was mentally and physically incapable of looking after them and that the children would go to an orphanage. Protests were held in support of the children by classmates from the city of Amersfoort and the case has become a cause celebre across the Netherlands.After a series of asylum rulings, a final decision was made last month that there were no grounds for Lily and Howick to stay. Armenia was a safe country and there was no risk of persecution, the Council of State concluded. The children would not end up on the street, it decided, and deportation was due to take place on 8 September.In a recent letter to Dutch newspaper Algemeen Dagblad, the children's mother said they were \"in hiding\" and in a \"safe place\".\"The stress is so high that I'm scared my children will break down if this goes ahead,\" she wrote, adding that she had been told by professionals that they were suffering from post traumatic stress disorder. But on Monday, the newspaper reported that the children had emerged from three days of hiding and reported to authorities.The Dutch immigration service told the newspaper that it would not go into individual cases.Appearing on a talk show on Dutch TV on Saturday, the children said they had been really shocked by news of their imminent deportation.\"We belong here. They say you're going back to Armenia but where am I going back to?\" said Lily.\"If we do end up there, we'll go into some sort of orphanage meant for a maximum of 20 children, but which already houses 30,\" Howick added.Several European countries have struggled with the deportation of children whose asylum cases have been rejected. Campaign group Defence for Children said they were still hoping that the Dutch migration secretary would overrule the court decision. They say there are 400 cases of children seeking asylum who have lived in the Netherlands for more than five years without a residence permit.There were protests in the Dutch town of Culemborg last month when a Ukrainian family, whose three children were born in the Netherlands, were deported after living there for 17 years.The Dutch immigration service turned down just over half of the 16,785 asylum applications made in 2017.The largest number of rejections was from citizens of Morocco and Algeria.While tens of thousands of unaccompanied minors entered Germany in 2015 and 2016, almost 90% of asylum claims were successful.",

            "content": "Ukraine's parliament has passed a law defining areas seized by pro-Russian separatists in the east of the country as temporarily occupied by Russia.The law on the reintegration of the region was backed by 280 MPs, calling Russia an \"aggressor\" state. Moscow condemned the move, saying it could only be considered as preparation \"for a new war\".More than 10,000 people have died in the eastern Donetsk and Luhansk region since the conflict began in April 2014.A month earlier Russia seized Ukraine's southern Crimea peninsula.Ukraine's lawmakers passed the law on Thursday after heated discussions in parliament that lasted three days. \"The Russian Federation is committing a crime of aggression against Ukraine and is temporarily occupying parts of its territory,\" the document says.It accuses Moscow of sending its armed units to the Donetsk and Luhansk regions, and not adhering to a ceasefire regime.Ukraine and the West accuse Russia of sending its troops to the region and arming the separatists.Moscow denies this, but admits that Russian \"volunteers\" are helping the rebels. In a statement on Thursday, the Russian foreign ministry accused Kiev of trying to solve the conflict in the east by force.It also said the new law violated the Minsk peace accords, which were agreed in 2015.The rise in tensions between Kiev and Moscow comes just weeks after Ukraine and the separatists exchanged hundreds of prisoners - in one of the biggest swaps since the conflict erupted.By BBC MonitoringThe new law is splashed across Ukrainian newspaper front pages on Friday - and many seem unimpressed.In a highly critical piece, the opposition tabloid Vesti expressed human rights concerns, asking \"who will be regarded as the 'enemy of the people', whose homes may be searched and who will make a profit on the trade [with the rebel regions]?\"News website Ukrayinska Pravda is also sceptical, saying: \"Despite the plaudits, both the authorities and the opposition admit: the law does not solve the problem of de-occupation.\" \"Contentious law adopted: How we will regain Donbass\", reads a headline in the KP newspaper, which also looks in detail at the \"controversial clauses that did not make it into the law\". Russia's influential Kommersant newspaper says the new law effectively cancels the Minsk Accords and sees Kiev \"turning its back on Paris and Berlin, the guarantors of the Minsk process, and putting the strategic stake on Washington.\"And Moskovsky Komsomolets says the Ukrainian authorities \"have permitted the ATO [anti-terrorist operation] soldiers to do everything they did illegally before.\"",

            "title": "What must Americans do during the anthem?",
            "content": "US President Donald Trump has criticised NFL players who kneel during the national anthem in protest at what they perceive as racial injustice.He calls it \"disrespecting the flag\" but supporters of the protest believe the players are exercising their right to free speech.But there is a breach of etiquette here enshrined in law. The Flag Code covers all aspects of etiquette in relation to the Stars and Stripes, including how to behave when the anthem is played. The code is never enforced, however, and there is no punishment for breaching it.The code states that persons present are expected to stand and face the flag, if there is one. Civilians should stand to attention with right hand over heart, while military personnel in uniform and veterans should salute throughout. A recent amendment to the code said that military personnel out of uniform could also salute.President Barack Obama famously neglected to put his hand over his heart during the 2008 election campaign. He explained his mistake by saying his grandfather taught him to do this only during the pledge, and to only sing during the anthem.On the balcony of the White House, President Trump needed a prompt from his wife Melania when he forgot to put his hand on his chest. Oh, say can you see by the dawn's early lightWhat so proudly we hailed at the twilight's last gleaming?Whose broad stripes and bright stars through the perilous fight,O'er the ramparts we watched were so gallantly streaming?And the rocket's red glare, the bombs bursting in air,Gave proof through the night that our flag was still there.Oh, say does that star-spangled banner yet waveO'er the land of the free and the home of the brave?Men not in uniform should remove any headdress with their right hand and hold it at their left shoulder, the code states. This is generally observed at sporting events. NFL players may not put on their helmets until after the anthem is played.The Flag Code makes no mention of whether the anthem should be sung by those present. However, singing the Star-Spangled Banner is encouraged from school onwards - in some schools it is compulsory. In 1942 the National Anthem Committee wrote that \"it is of paramount importance that emphasis be placed upon the singing of the National Anthem\".Numerous manufacturers of flag merchandise could be in trouble here. The Flag Code states that it should not be used for any advertising purpose, and should not be embroidered or printed on any material for temporary use.It should also never be part of a costume or sports uniform, or used as \"wearing apparel, bedding, or drapery\". Olympic medal winners who celebrate their success by covering themselves in the flag should take note.Also, the flag should never be displayed upside down, except as a symbol of \"dire distress\".Protesters throughout the world frequently set alight US flags to demonstrate their hatred of America, but you would not face prosecution for doing so in the US itself. In 1990 the Supreme Court invalidated a federal law against desecration of the flag on the grounds that it was in violation of the First Amendment on freedom of speech.In fact, burning the flag is sometimes even encouraged. The Flag Code says that no disrespect should be shown to it, but also allows for any flag which is not fit for display to be \"destroyed in a dignified way, preferably by burning\".Experts say that US flag etiquette is important because was created out of respect for the country's historical heritage. But the code was first drawn up only in 1923 under the auspices of the American Legion, and only became law when the US was at war, in 1942.",

            "title": "Brazil museum fire: Funding cuts blamed as icon is gutted",
            "content": "Officials in Brazil have blamed lack of funding for a huge fire that has ravaged the country's National Museum.One of the largest anthropology and natural history collections in the Americas was almost totally destroyed in Sunday's fire in Rio de Janeiro.This included the 12,000-year-old remains of a woman known as \"Luzia\" - the oldest discovered in Latin America.There had also been a string of complaints about the dilapidated state of the 200-year-old museum. \"We never had adequate support,\" its deputy director said after the fire.Experts had warned for years of a serious fire risk to the building.Presidential candidate Marina Silva criticised lack of investment.\"Given the financial straits of the Federal University of Rio de Janeiro and all the other public universities the last three years, this was a tragedy that could be seen coming,\" Ms Silva, a left-wing politician standing in next month's election, tweeted.The fire started on Sunday evening, after the building - a 19th Century former royal palace - closed for the day. The cause is not known, but Culture Minister Sergio Sa Leitao was quoted in Brazilian media as saying it may have been ignited by a small paper hot air balloon landing on the roof. No injuries have been reported but most of the 20 million items the museum contained went up in flames.Brazil's President Michel Temer said in a tweet that it was a \"sad day for all Brazilians\" as \"200 years of work, research and knowledge were lost\".Mr Sa Leitao said it was a \"tragedy that could have been avoided\" but a reconstruction effort would begin. Prof Paulo Buckup, an expert in fish science at the museum, arrived at 19:30 (22:30 GMT) local time to find parts of the building where animal specimens were kept still intact.\"It's unfortunate but the firefighters were not in a position to do anything, to fight anything,\" he told BBC Brasil's Julia Carneiro. \"They had no water, no ladders, no equipment. \"So we took the initiative to get in to try and save what we could. We had to break down doors. The soldiers helped us carry things.\"Prof Buckup rushed into the burning building to save its extensive collection of molluscs rescuing \"a few thousand\" specimens, a \"tiny\" part of the collection. \"I don't know how many tens of thousands of insects and crustaceans were lost,\" he says.\"I feel very sorry for my colleagues, some of whom have worked here for 30 or 40 years. Now all evidence of their work is lost, their lives have lost meaning, too.\"A deputy director at the museum, Luiz Fernando Dias Duarte, expressed \"immense anger\", and accused Brazilian authorities of a \"lack of attention\".\"We fought years ago, in different governments, to obtain resources to adequately preserve everything that was destroyed today.\" Demonstrators gathered at the gates of the museum on Monday morning, protesting against the budget cuts that they blame for the fire. Police were seen firing tear gas. One issue appears to be the lack of a sprinkler system. Mr Dias Duarte told Globo TV that a $5.3m (£4.1m) modernisation plan agreed in June would have included the installation of modern fire prevention equipment, but only after October's elections.  A major dinosaur exhibition, which was forced to shut following a termite attack five months ago, had recently reopened only thanks to a crowdfunding campaign. Museum librarian Edson Vargas da Silva told local media that the building had wooden floors and contained \"a lot of things that burn very fast\", such as paper documents. The museum, Brazil's oldest, is managed by the Federal University of Rio de Janeiro and the federal government has been struggling with huge budget imbalances in recent years.The deficit was about 8% of GDP in 2017, only slightly down from a record 10% two years earlier.But Rio de Janeiro state is also facing a budget crisis. Roberto Robadey, a spokesman for the Rio fire department, is quoted by the Associated Press news agency as saying that the hydrants closest to the museum were not working and that firefighters had to get water from a nearby lake.By Katy Watson, BBC South America correspondentThe pale yellow building is still standing - but the windows are burned out, the roof has gone and its insides are black. Throughout the day, firefighters, investigators and even museum staff have been going into the building and every so often they have brought out bits of artefacts or anything they think they can salvage from the rubble. Hundreds of people gathered outside, watching the developments - many of them in tears.  Some researchers and academics I spoke to said they were still hopeful that some material on the ground floor could be saved - that is if it hadn't been crushed by the force of the upper floors collapsing on top of it. With their knowledge of where the archives were kept, they've been tipping off firefighters on where to go to rescue material in the hope that at least some of Brazil's most important history can be saved.Its 20 million artefacts included fossils and dinosaur bones.The jewel in the crown for many visitors was \"Luzia\".\"Luzia is a priceless loss for everyone interested in civilization,\" museum director Paulo Knauss told the AFP news agency.Using her skull, experts had produced a digital image of her face, which was used as the base for a sculpture that was also gutted by the fire.Another popular exhibit was the Bendegó meteorite, weighing more than five tonnes and discovered in Minas Gerais region in the 18th Century. Images taken in the aftermath suggest it is still intact. The building was also home to items covering the centuries from the arrival of the Portuguese in the 1500s to the declaration of a republic in 1889.The ethnology collection had unique pieces from the pre-Columbian era and artefacts from indigenous cultures.Portugal's royal family transferred the court to the building in 1808, when the country faced the threat of invasion from Napoleon.The museum was established in 1818, with the aim of promoting scientific research by making its collection available to specialists.

            "title": "Colin Kaepernick anthem row: What happened next",
            "content": "When American football player Colin Kaepernick refused to stand for the national anthem, he unleashed a storm of controversy that shows no sign of dying down.The San Francisco 49er's quarterback stayed seated as The Star-Spangled Banner played in a pre-game ceremony in protest against what he called the oppression of black people in the US.The gesture has provoked a huge reaction, with some applauding him as principled, others seeing him as disrespectful and unpatriotic. Here are some of the key responses.An often-repeated criticism of Kaepernick has been that his actions are offensive to members of the US military. Guidelines say all Americans should stand and face the flag during the anthem - by not doing so, as the argument goes, Kaepernick was insulting people prepared to die for it.Some former servicemen and women disagree, however, and have been offering their support using the #VeteransForKaepernick hashtag.However backing for Kaepernick among the US military is far from unanimous. In one widely shared response, Senior Airman Brian Kolfage, who lost three limbs in Iraq in 2004, said \"I'll be sure to stand for the both us\" next time the anthem played.Meanwhile the Veterans of Foreign Wars of the United States group said \"the American flag and our national anthem stand for something, and the Veterans of Foreign Wars of the United States salutes all who stand with us\".Angry fans of the 49ers have been posting videos of themselves burning Kaepernick jerseys.\"When you don't rise for the flag to show your respect for the men and women who fought and continue to fight for our freedom you start #losing #fans,\" wrote one.Kaepernick led San Francisco to the 2013 Super Bowl, but since then his status in the team has declined and he has lost his starting place.His team support his protest, saying \"we recognise the right of an individual to choose and participate, or not, in our celebration of the national anthem\".One man who knows what it is like to be attacked for making a political gesture at a sporting event is Tommie Smith, the US sprinter who famously raised his fist in protest against racial discrimination during his gold medal ceremony at the 1968 Olympics.Smith gave Kaepernick his backing. \"He's being vilified in how he brings the truth out,\" he told USA Today. \"I support him because he's bringing the truth out, regardless of how done. If it's not done violently, at least he should be heard.\"He suggested that Kaepernick was only continuing a fight against systemic racism that was yet to be won. \"There are a lot of battles to fight because it's a big, long war,\" he said.The Republican presidential nominee gave a typically forthright response, calling Kaepernick's action a \"terrible thing\".\"Maybe he should find a country that works better for him,\" Mr Trump told KIRO radio in Seattle. \"Let him try. It won't happen.\"There has been no word yet from rival Hillary Clinton.Kaepernick himself is no fan of either candidate. Asked whether he had deliberately timed the protest to coincide with election year, he said both \"represent the issue that we have in this country right now\".He went onto call Mr Trump \"openly racist\" and cited Mrs Clinton's description of black children as \"super-predators\".In his reaction, Jerry Rice, who won three Super Bowl championships while with the 49ers, took a similar line to many, backing Kaepernick's freedom to express himself while disagreeing with the method. But three little words made Rice himself come under fire. The phrase \"All Lives Matter\" has proved hugely toxic, with critics saying those who use the phrase are at best missing the point of the debate, at worst being outright racist.Kaepernick has been a vocal supporter of the Black Lives Matter movement and referenced police brutality in explaining his action.The row has triggered a complex debate about free speech and patriotism, the sport and the military, and for some commentators was a chance to examine the meaning of the Star Spangled Banner itself.The anthem is best known for its opening verse, which is normally the only one sung. It was written in 1814 by Francis Scott Key, after witnessing the British bombardment of Fort McHenry in Baltimore.But a lesser known third verse, which has the line \"no refuge could save the hireling and slave\" is often interpreted as celebrating the deaths of slaves who died siding with the British.Writing in the Root, Jason Johnson calls the song \"one of the most racist, pro-slavery, anti-black songs in the American lexicon\".

            "title": "Brazil National Museum fire: Key treasures at risk",
            "content": "The National Museum of Brazil in Rio de Janeiro is a treasure trove which contains more than 20 million scientific and historical items. A massive fire spread through the 200-year-old institution on Sunday engulfing almost all of its rooms and gutting large parts of the building.Most of its priceless collection is thought to have been burnt. BBC News takes a look at some of the museum's most treasured items. It is not yet clear if they are among those destroyed.The museum was home to Luzia, the nickname given to what are thought to be the oldest human remains found in the Americas. The remains were found in a cave in 1975 in in the state of Minas Gerais, north of Rio, by French archaeologist Annette Laming-Emperaire. Tests suggest the skull and bones belonged to a woman in her 20s who was just under five feet tall (1.5m). They are estimated to be 11,500 years old. The largest iron meteorite to be found in Brazil. Weighing 5,260kg (11,600lb) it was found by a boy looking for a lost cow in the state of Bahía in north-east Brazil in 1784. Transporting the meteorite turned out to be a major endeavour. An attempt to move it in 1785 by a cart pulled by 20 pairs of oxen ended in disaster when the cart ran out of control down a hill and landed in the bed of a stream.The meteorite was not recovered until more than a century later when a retired Brazilian naval officer was put in charge of getting it to Rio. It finally arrived in the National Museum in 1888 after a long journey by specially built cart, rail and ship. Partly due to its size and partly to its laborious transportation to Rio, the meteorite became famous beyond Brazil and in 1889 a wood reproduction was exhibited at the Universal Exposition in Paris. The reconstructed skeleton of a Maxakalisaurus was the biggest dinosaur on display at the National Museum in Rio. Parts of the skeleton of a Maxakalisaurus were found in Minas Gerais in 1998. The plant-eating giant lived 80 million years ago in the area now occupied by Brazil. A million people came to see the display, according to museum figures. The room housing the 13m-long (44ft) skeleton had just re-opened in July after termites ate through the base on which the Maxakalisaurus stood.The museum had resorted to crowd-funding to repair the damage. A Roman fresco from the ancient city of Pompeii was one of the star exhibits of the museum's Greco-Roman collection. The fresco had survived the eruption of Mount Vesuvius in the year 79AD. The archaeological section of the museum held more than 100,000 objects with a priceless collection of Brazilian artefacts dating back to pre-Columbian times. Funerary urns, Andean mummies, textiles and ceramics from across Latin America were also gathered throughout the 19th Century to be studied and displayed in the museum.Some of the items on display came from the personal collection of Emperor Pedro II of Brazil. The museum is housed in a former palace which during colonial times was the official residence of the Portuguese royal family.The building in its current form dates back to the early 19th Century when a rich merchant donated it to the Portuguese royal family, which extended the manor house and turned it into the neoclassical São Cristóvão palace. After Brazil became independent from Portugal, the palace became the residence of Brazil's Emperor Pedro I. Pedro I's son, Pedro II, was born in the palace in 1825 and grew up there. The imperial family left the country after Brazil became a republic in 1889.In 1892, the National Museum of Rio de Janeiro, itself founded in 1818, moved into the palace. Millions of people have since visited its vast exhibits on anthropology, archaeology and natural history. ",

            "content": "People in Jersey have been reminiscing over a board game created during World War Two after one was found in a loft.The Monopoly-style game - called Occupation - may have been a form of light-hearted resistance, said a survivor.Printed exclusively on the island, the game refers to the difficulties faced by islanders during the Nazi occupation from 1940 to 1945.Simon Griffiths found the game when he moved into his new home in Jersey.More news from the Channel IslandsIslanders Diana and Cliff Petit also own copies -  both of which were given to them as children.Mrs Petit said its creators may have thought \"right, we'll do this, we'll show them (the German forces)\".Mrs Petit believes she was given her copy of the game at some point in 1943 while her husband, Cliff, was given his as a Christmas present when he was nine.\"I remember having great enjoyment playing with it during the occupation, where we didn't have much else,\" said Mrs Petit.She said she was not sure what the German forces' reaction to the game would have been, had they seen it, and, at the time, her family enjoyed it \"as a game\" and did not take it \"too seriously\".Mr Petit said nothing around the board was too controversial.\"To be honest, I don't think they would have risked going that far,\" he added.One tile on the board resonated with Mr Petit in particular - relating to buying eggs, a commodity during the occupation.He said he remembered his mother walking across the island to get \"just two eggs\" to feed his father, who was ill and died during the war.The couple, from St Brelade, brought their versions of the game to the town hall in St Helier in 1995 for the 50th anniversary of Jersey's liberation on 9 May 1945.Val Nelson, from Jersey Heritage, said an original copy of the game was recently donated to the island's archives.\"It's always been said about the British sense of humour that gets you through any of the hard times,\" she said.Ms Nelson said the game was \"advertised freely\" and it was noticeable it did not say anything derogatory about occupation forces.\"It doesn't even say go to jail, it says go to Gloucester Street,\" she added.\"Everybody at that point would know Gloucester Street was the prison which held political prisoners, as well as the usual petty criminals.\"Read more on the German Occupation of the Channel Islands.",

While campaigning to becoming India's prime minister in 2013, Mr Modi said \"Every Indian regrets Sardar Patel did not become the first prime minister\".Once completed, the bronze-clad statue - which was begun in 2013 - will be nearly twice as tall as New York's Statue of Liberty.It is hoped the site will become a significant tourist attraction for the country's westernmost state.There will be a viewing gallery some 153m up, near the chest of the statue.The statue is located some 200km (125 miles) from the state's main city, Ahmedabad.More than 2,500 workers are working to get the statue ready in time, with several hundred migrant labourers from China also contributing to the efforts.",

We're not under the illusion that you hold a concert and then the world is saved,\" he said. \"But sometimes it's important to show that you're not alone.\"At the same time the concert was taking place, local police announced that they had arrested a man suspected of attacking a journalist during far-right demonstrations on Saturday.But the concert was not without its opponents.German President Frank-Walter Steinmeier was criticised by some conservatives for posting the event to his Facebook page, as one of the bands performing had previously been prosecuted for advocating far-left violence.",

            "title": "Why Australia's PM is 'keeping enemies close' in government reboot",
            "content": "Party infighting was behind Malcolm Turnbull's removal as Australia's prime minister last week. The BBC's Hywel Griffith looks at how some of the key players have fared. After the drama of \"the spill\", new Prime Minister Scott Morrison cast himself as a next-generation leader, anxious to end the plotting of the past. But his newly assembled cast of frontbenchers includes several protagonists from last week's chaos in leading roles.The first to be sworn in was Peter Dutton, the man who initiated the downfall of Malcolm Turnbull, who has returned as Home Affairs Minister.One of Mr Dutton's key supporters was Angus Taylor, who has landed the key position of Energy Minister. Now former prime minister Tony Abbott, who many accuse of orchestrating last week's events from the wings, has been brought back into the limelight as the government's likely indigenous affairs envoy. According to Dr Stewart Jackson, from the University of Sydney, it could be a smart move by Mr Morrison.Rather than rewarding \"insurgency\" (as Mr Turnbull put it), Dr Jackson argues that giving Mr Abbott a new role in government - but outside of the cabinet - is a way of keeping him busy. \"And it means you can send him off to the Northern Territory often, and the Northern Territory is far away [from Canberra],\" Dr Jackson says.Mr Abbott's part in last week's calamitous episode has drawn wide criticism. Several Liberal Party members have publicly condemned Mr Abbott, while former Labor prime minister Kevin Rudd described him as a \"giant wrecking ball of Australian politics\".For his part, Mr Abbott has asserted \"the era of the political assassin is over,\" without making it fully clear whether he saw himself as the assassin or the victim. Mr Abbott was himself ousted by Mr Turnbull in 2015.But as he discussed Mr Morrison's job offer, Mr Abbott told 2GB radio that \"we've had far too much backstabbing, we've had far too much leaking and briefing, and I think we can put all of that behind us\".Similar motives may have been at play in offering a new drought envoy role to former deputy PM Barnaby Joyce, who had his own spectacular falling out with Mr Turnbull.Dr Jackson says: \"I did think initially, is this way of saying [to Mr Abbott] 'Go out there into the bush, along with Barnaby, and spend all your time out there so you won't be here making trouble?'\"But, in fact, Dr Jackson believes that Mr Morrison is hoping to harness both men's prominent media profiles in order to sell the government's message.\"Tony Abbott's capacity for being able to get on to the media is renowned and I don't think this is going to stop him doing that,\" he argues.\"But at least it will refocus people's attention, and ask what are you doing on indigenous affairs - a tricky portfolio at the best of times.\"Although Mr Dutton was his direct rival in the leadership contest, Mr Morrison decided very quickly not to banish him to the backbenches, either. By returning Mr Dutton to his old job, he is perhaps keeping his friends close, and his enemies closer. Mr Turnbull has already announced that he will quit parliament.With nine months at most before the next election, the government desperately needs to show the voters a united front. And according to Dr Jackson, the prime minister has at least given himself \"a reasonable chance of salvaging something\".",

The exploitation of the Amazon rainforest, much of which is in Brazil, has been a major international worry, since the wilderness is a vital regulator of the climate. A former Portuguese colony, Brazil has a highly diverse population, including indigenous Americans and the descendants of African slaves and European settlers.

A veteran of the centrist Brazilian Democratic Movement Party (PMDB), Mr Temer will serve out the rest of Ms Rousseff's term to the end of 2018.Once political allies, Mr Temer served as vice-president in Ms Rousseff's government for over five years before playing a key role in impeachment proceedings against her. He acted as interim president during her trial.In his first televised cabinet meeting following his inauguration, Mr Temer pledged to bring back \"political stability\" to the recession-stricken country.\"My only interest is in handing over to my successor a country that is reconciled, pacified and growing economically,\" the former law professor said.Descriptions of his public persona have ranged from \"a good negotiator\" to \"conspirator\", and Mr Temer has himself been implicated in corruption scandals. Television dominates South America's biggest media market. Media ownership is very concentrated and corporate giants such as Globo are the main players in broadcasting and the press.The constitution guarantees a free press and there is vigorous political debate in the media. But freedom groups say Brazil is one of the region's most violent countries for journalists.Around 50% of Brazilians are online. They are among the world's most enthusiastic users of social media.1500 - Portuguese land in the area and claim it for the Portuguese crown.1822 - The son of the Portuguese king declares independence from Portugal and crowns himself Pedro I, emperor of Brazil.1888 - Slavery is abolished.

There was a very aggressive 'don't even touch your phone' rule so I drew the gig. pic.twitter.com/1oyND3DM9LEnd of Twitter post  by @brucedaisleyIt is not the first time phones have been banned at gigs - but it might be the dawning of a new age of enforcement.Chris Rock fans will recall a similar ban as they were forced to keep their mobile phones in a locked pouch while at his shows last year.But Hart's ban does not include any such technology - instead relying on so-called \"cell phone security\" to police the venue and enforce the rule.Cell phones security in the O2, Kevin Hart is not about to let any footage slip online 😂 pic.twitter.com/KFDKcuI6KlEnd of Twitter post  by @lorenzoofficialFans were warned in advance of the ban, which has applied to Hart's entire UK tour.O2 advised attendees that \"anyone caught using a phone or camera before or during the show will be ejected with no refund\", with the other tour venues issuing similar warnings.And one fan shared a picture of a leaflet apparently handed out at the show reinforcing the rules.Cell Phone security is tight at @KevinHart4real ... fuming if you get kicked out for talking 🙈😂 pic.twitter.com/7ZgSe3OoiKEnd of Twitter post  by @KingSMJ23Some fans did not expect the rules to be so strictly enforced, as one person reported being removed from a show for sending \"a five word text\" to her mother.Vibe Tickets founder Luke Massie called the decision \"ridiculous\" and said that fans \"should be entitled\" to use mobile phones during a gig.This is ridiculous @KevinHart4real, fans pay good money to attend live events. They should be entitled to use their phones. Capture the moment and re live the memory as and when they like. I hope this fan is contacted and given the opportunity to see you again.End of Twitter post  by @LukeMassieOthers were less understanding and pointed out that it was repeatedly stated that phones were prohibited inside the auditoriumOne person joked that there were \"about 500 warnings\" to put away mobiles, while another said that he \"loved\" the blanket ban on phones.And Twitter user Luke Robinson was so enamoured with the experience that he urged other comedians to follow the same rule.Kevin Hart banned mobile phones etc from the performance, and it actually makes the experience much better, more acts should do that 🤷🏾‍♂️End of Twitter post  by @BambiMusicMeanwhile, the \"cell phone police\" were not able to spot everyone that broke the rules, with one pair \"living life dangerously\" by taking a risky snap at the show.But this was not a risk that unofficial Kevin Hart artist Bruce Daisley was willing to take, as he produced an analogue \"selfie\" of his trip to the show.Did I get a selfie of my time? Yes. No thanks to the camera ban. pic.twitter.com/AYN7gBAqmYEnd of Twitter post 2 by @brucedaisley",

            "content": "End of Youtube post  by BBC NewsIn Romania's western city of Timisoara, Romanians, Hungarians and Germans have lived side-by-side for centuries. Together, they began the revolution in 1989 which overthrew the communist dictatorship of Nicolae Ceausescu.Today, Timisoara welcomes, or at least tolerates, its new arrivals: thousands of Afghans, Pakistanis, Kurds and Syrians on their way to Western Europe.Some fall in love with the kindness they encounter and end up staying in Timisoara. But most place their lives in the hands of smugglers to reach the West.In October last year, 18 people set out on that journey.It cost the lives of both the smuggler and the young mother of twin girls, and left scars on many of the others.The group set out with a local smuggler guide on 1 October 2017, hoping to cross the border into Hungary on their way to Germany or Italy.Some of them knew each other from Kurdistan. Others met in Timisoara or in the dark, whispering woods and followed each other over the border. For two nights they walked, resting during the day in fields of tall maize. \"It was so cold,\" Aidi told me.\"The women and children suffered the most,\" said Safaa. On the third night, just before 02:00, a Tunisian smuggler in a black minivan with Italian plates picked them up. He hurried them inside and set off for the border. \"I think the Hungarian police were already watching us,\" Murat told me. \"They came after us so quickly.\"When the smuggler saw flashing blue lights in his mirror he shouted at his passengers to get down - and he put his foot on the accelerator. The van smashed into a police roadblock, then hurtled down a motorway embankment. Baran, the mother of nine-year-old twins Hashem and Pasha, died on the spot. The driver died later that day.Hospitals in Szeged and Oroshaza treated the 17 survivors. Hali was in the worst condition. She had a cracked skull, broken ribs, broken arms and legs, and cracked pelvic bones. When I first met her three months after the crash she could sit up in bed, but hardly speak. Her son Safaa, 21, spent all day at her bedside. His father in Iraq and one of his brothers in Germany paid for all the medical expenses, as well as Safaa's cheap accommodation near the hospital. By now the bill was already $10,000 (£7,700), and the family's funds had dried up. Safaa, like all the survivors, praised the excellent medical care given to them. Although the Hungarian government has passed laws criminalising migrants and those who give them aid, the doctors have treated them like victims. Aidi, 20, praised Dr Zoltan, the surgeon who fixed her broken legs when she feared she would never walk again.And a local Baptist pastor, Noemi Nikodem, befriended her in the hospital and became like a sister to her. Hungarian police were less friendly.They were a constant presence in the wards, pressuring doctors to sign papers as soon as the patients were deemed fit enough to face deportation back to Romania. All were sent back to Timisoara except for the orphaned children: Hashem and Pasha, the nine year-old twins; Horia, a 12-year-old girl travelling alone; Hali because she was too badly injured and Hali's children Safaa and Sonia. It was not the end of the journey for the rest.Still barely able to walk, Akhir stowed away in a lorry in late November. He reached Germany after a 37-hour journey and has applied for asylum. Murat, Khose and 10-year-old Aiman reached Hanover in May. But that was after spending two months in detention in the Czech Republic, when their hiding place in another lorry was discovered. Aidi hid under a blanket in a car that crossed the Romanian border into Hungary at night. In Timisoara, the rumour is that the smuggler gets $2,000 and the border guards $1,000 for each illicit passenger - something Hungarian police deny. \"The Hungarian police pay special attention to the prevention and detection of corruption, and act swiftly against any officer who breaks the law,\" the police told the BBC.Aidi, now in a temporary home in the German town of Regensburg, told me: \"I was so afraid that the police would find me. Or that the car would have an accident again.\" But she sailed through unscathed, and has now been reunited with her parents and granted asylum.Samir made it to Italy in the back of a truck in April. The twins, Hashem and Pasha, were adopted by relatives in Germany.Horia was taken in by an aunt in Vienna, and could finally leave the children's home where they were placed near Budapest in March.Thanks to the mediation of the UN refugee agency UNHCR, Safaa and Hali have been placed in Hungary's last open refugee camp while German authorities consider their request for family reunification.All the others, contacted by the BBC, confirmed that they had reached Germany. One, Omar, was deported from Germany back to Romania after his asylum request failed. Nine months after the fatal crash, 14 of the 17 survivors have made it to their chosen destinations in Western Europe, though still scarred by the accident. Despite the chorus of politicians pronouncing the Balkan migrant route closed, it is still open - but just a crack.",

There was a lot of gunfire at our gate... when I came out, I saw many people injured on the ground and others dead,\" she told Reuters.Somalia has faced instability and violence since 1991, when the military government was overthrown.The ousting of Mohamed Siad Barre led to a decades-long civil war between rival warlords, and two northern regions - Somaliland and Puntland - effectively broke away from Somalia.Much of the country has effectively been a war zone.A UN-backed unity government was formed in 2012. Al-Shabab has since been driven out of many urban areas but still controls territory in rural regions and carries out gun attacks and bombings on military and civilian targets.The militant group has imposed a strict version of Sharia in areas under its control, including stoning to death women accused of adultery and amputating the hands of thieves.A truck attack in Mogadishu in October last year killed at least 500 people in the deadliest bombing in Somalia.A man accused of leading an al-Shabab unit that carried out the attack was sentenced to death in February.",

            "content": "The Saudi-led coalition in Yemen has expressed regret over \"mistakes\" made in a deadly air strike on a bus.More than 40 children were killed in the strike in a market in northern Saada province on 9 August, drawing international condemnation.In a statement on Saturday, the coalition pledged to hold those responsible for the strike accountable.But a spokesman for the coalition's own investigation maintained that the strike had targeted a Houthi leader.The head of the coalition's Joint Incidents Assessment Team (JIAT), Lt Gen Mansour al-Mansour, said its investigation had found that the bus was carrying Houthi leaders and fighters and was therefore a \"legitimate\" military target, but admitted that the location of the strike had led to collateral damage.A statement carried by the Saudi state news agency SPA on Saturday said: \"The Joint Forces Command of the Coalition expresses regret over the mistakes, extends its sympathies, condolences and solidarity to the families of the victims.\"The coalition said it would co-ordinate with the Yemeni government to compensate families of victims and would also review its rules of engagement.The coalition insists it never deliberately targets civilians, but human rights groups have accused it of bombing markets, schools, hospitals and residential areas.Earlier this week, the coalition rejected the findings of a UN report which said that war crimes may have been committed by all parties in the conflict.UN experts accused Yemeni government forces, the coalition backing them, and the rebel Houthi movement of making little effort to minimise civilian casualties.Last week, another strike to the south of the port city of Hudaydah killed at least 22 children and four women.Yemen has been devastated by a conflict that escalated in early 2015, when the Houthis seized control of much of the west of the country and forced President Abdrabbuh Mansour Hadi to flee abroad.Alarmed by the rise of a group they saw as an Iranian proxy, the UAE, Saudi Arabia and seven other Arab states intervened in an attempt to restore the government.Almost 10,000 people - two-thirds of them civilians - have been killed and 55,000 others injured in the fighting, according to the United Nations.The fighting and a partial blockade by the coalition has also left 22 million people in need of humanitarian aid, created the world's largest food security emergency, and led to a cholera outbreak that is thought to have affected a million people.",

            "title": "Palestinians brand US aid cut to UN group 'a flagrant assault'",
            "content": "Palestinian officials have condemned the US decision to end all funding to the UN's Palestinian refugee agency.The US has been the largest donor to the United Nations Relief and Works Agency (Unrwa) - but now says the organisation is \"irredeemably flawed\".Palestinian President Mahmoud Abbas's spokesman has called the move a \"flagrant assault against the Palestinian people\".However, an Israeli official told AFP: \"Israel supports the US move\".Unrwa says it currently supports more than five million Palestinians in Gaza, the West Bank, Jordan, Syria and Lebanon, including providing health care, education and social services.The US has been the largest single donor to Unrwa, providing $368m (£284m) in 2016 and funding almost 30% of its operations in the region.But in January, the administration of President Donald Trump withheld more than half of its planned funding to Unrwa, saying it would keep back $65m unless the body carried out \"reforms\". On Friday, the US state department said in a statement that \"the US will no longer commit further funding to this irredeemably flawed operation\".The state department said the US had shouldered a \"very disproportionate share of the burden of Unrwa's costs\", and that the international community should contribute more.It has also said it is unhappy that Unrwa has kept expanding the number of people eligible for assistance, and says its business model is \"simply unsustainable and has been in crisis mode for many years\".This links to a wider disagreement over which Palestinians are refugees with a right to return to the homes they fled following the 1948 Arab-Israeli war.The UN says there are about five million Palestinian refugees, including the descendants of people who fled the 1948 war.However, the US and Israel disagree with how this number is calculated, and say the number of Palestinian refugees should be much smaller.President Trump also appears unhappy with how US aid to the region has been received.He has previously tweeted that the US has not received \"appreciation or respect\" for the aid it has provided, and that the Palestinians are unwilling to negotiate with Israel. US ambassador to the UN, Nikki Haley, said earlier this week: \"There's an endless number of refugees that continue to get assistance, but more importantly, the Palestinians continue to bash America.\"The state department says it remains \"deeply concerned regarding the impact upon innocent Palestinians, especially school children, of the failure of Unrwa\".The organisation's chief spokesperson, Chris Gunness, told the BBC the impact of the US move would be devastating.\"It's likely to be widespread, profound, dramatic and unpredictable because, let's make no mistake, some of the most marginalised and fragile and vulnerable communities in the Middle East are going to likely suffer because of this.\"Mr Gunness says 526,000 schoolchildren receive a Unrwa education every day, while it also assists \"1.7 million food insecure people\". \"We do assistance to disabled refugees, to women, to vulnerable children. The list goes on and, as I say, the impact on them is likely to be utterly devastating.\"Germany's foreign ministry has said it will increase contributions to Unrwa to try to maintain stability.Palestinian officials have condemned the US move. A spokesman for President Abbas told Reuters the decision was in \"defiance of UN resolutions\", and would not change the fact that the US \"no longer has a role in the region\" and \"is not a part of the solution\".The Palestinian Liberation Organization said a statement that the cut was \"a cruel and irresponsible move targeting the most vulnerable segment of Palestinian society\". The Palestinian militant group Hamas told Reuters that the move was a \"grave escalation against the Palestinian people\".Palestinian officials have already accused the US of pro-Israel bias, especially after Mr Trump recognised Jerusalem as Israel's capital and opened a US embassy in Jerusalem, despite the city being claimed by both sides.The move overturned decades of US neutrality on the issue and attracted international criticism.Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu has previously called for Unrwa's funding to be cut gradually and its responsibilities transferred to the UN's global refugee agency, the UNHCR, arguing that it \"perpetuates the Palestinian problem\".On Saturday, an official in Mr Netanyahu's office told AFP that \"Israel supports the US move\", adding: \"Consolidating the refugee status of Palestinians is one of the problems that perpetuates the conflict.\"However, some Israelis have previously raised concerns that weakening Unrwa could cause regional instability and create more extremism in the region.",

            "content": "China has blocked access to the website of Australia's national broadcaster, the Australian Broadcasting Corp (ABC).The ABC said users in China were \"abruptly\" blocked from visiting its site and apps two weeks ago.Chinese regulators told the ABC the site had breached the country's laws, but did not specify any violations.China operates a strict internet censorship regime and often blocks access to foreign sites if they publish content it does not want people to see. The BBC News and the New York Times websites are also unavailable in China at present.The ABC's China-based journalists said they had confirmed the site had been blocked, after making several enquiries about its status. \"The ABC's website and apps are usually accessible to Chinese web users and are not subject to the 'Great Firewall' of censorship, but access was abruptly stopped on August 22,\" journalists Bill Birtles and Matthew Carney wrote.The broadcaster said it had not been able to confirm the reason for the ban.An official at the Office of the Central Cyberspace Affairs Commission told the journalists: \"China's internet is fully open. We welcome internet enterprises from all over the world to provide good information to the netizens of China.\"However, state cyber sovereignty rights shall be maintained towards some overseas websites violating China's laws and regulations, spreading rumours, pornographic information, gambling, violent terrorism and some other illegal harmful information which will endanger state security and damage national pride.\"Prime Minister Scott Morrison said the ban was an issue for China.\"China's a sovereign country, they make decisions about what happens there, we make decisions about what happens here,\" he told radio station 3AW.The ABC launched a Chinese-language version of its news site last year.The latest move comes amid a period of diplomatic tensions between the two nations over reports of China's alleged interference in Australian politics and society. This had led to Canberra enacting new laws aimed at preventing foreign interference.Last year, China's embassy in Canberra heavily criticised Australia media reports, including an investigation from the ABC and Fairfax Media, about Beijing's influence in Australia. \"Those reports, which were made up out of thin air and filled with Cold War mentality and ideological bias, reflected a typical anti-China hysteria and paranoi[a],\" the embassy said.Last month, Canberra also effectively barred Chinese telecommunications firm Huawei from competing for its 5G network, after it extended national security regulations on the infrastructure project.",

            "title": "Obituary: John McCain",
            "content": "John McCain was the Vietnam war hero who became one of America's most high-profile politicians.His brand of common-sense conservatism often saw him clash with his Republican allies and he was a fierce critic of the presidency of Donald Trump.He gained a reputation for being a dealmaker, someone who was prepared to compromise to get the job done.But he failed to win the 2008 presidential election, facing criticism from some quarters for his choice of Alaska governor Sarah Palin as his running mate.John Sidney McCain III was born on 29 Aug 1936 at Coco Solo Naval Air Station in the Panama Canal Zone, an area then under US control. Naval service was in his blood, both his father and grandfather ending their naval careers as four star admirals.His father's various postings saw the young McCain attending a host of different schools before he enrolled in the United States Naval Academy at Annapolis, Maryland.There he established a reputation for leadership, coupled with a fine disdain for authority. The latter trait, along with his propensity to do just enough to achieve grades in subjects he found boring, saw him graduate in 1958 near the bottom of his class. He moved on to Pensacola in Florida, dubbed the cradle of naval aviation where, after a two-and-a-half year course, he left with his pilot's qualifications and a reputation as a party animal.He wasn't the most competent of flyers. While still under training he crashed a plane into the sea, leading him to be dubbed \"cocky, occasionally cavalier and prone to testing limits\".\"John was what they call a push-the-envelope guy,\" was the verdict of one of the pilots who flew with him.After being assigned to fly Skyraider aircraft from a US carrier in the Mediterranean he flew his plane into electrical wires in Spain, causing a power failure in the surrounding area.In 1967 he was transferred to the US carrier Forrestal which was engaged in the operation dubbed \"Rolling Thunder\" - the sustained bombing of North Vietnam. Following a fire on the Forrestal, in which he was injured, he transferred to the USS Oriskany.On 26 Oct 1967 he was shot down while flying a mission over Hanoi. Badly injured - having fractured both arms and a leg when he ejected - he was captured by North Vietnamese troops.He was refused all but the most rudimentary medical care, and interrogated under torture. The beatings only stopped when the North Vietnamese discovered he was the son of an admiral. In March 1968, he was placed in solitary confinement where he remained for two years.When his father became commander of US forces in Vietnam, his captors - sensing a propaganda opportunity - offered to release him. McCain refused unless every US prisoner captured before him was released first.His captors restarted the brutal torture regime to the extent that McCain, beaten and suffering from dysentery, attempted suicide. He was eventually released after five and half years in captivity, but with lasting injuries.He returned to find his wife Carol, whom he had married in 1965, had been badly injured in a car accident which had left her disfigured.A spell at the Navy's liaison office to the US Senate in 1977 kindled an interest in politics. He also began dating a teacher, Cindy Lou Hensley, whom he married in 1980 after his first wife had granted him a divorce. In 1981 he quit the Navy and set out to run for Congress, winning a seat in Phoenix, Arizona, where his new father-in-law ran a beer distribution company.He was a strong supporter of the then-president, Ronald Reagan, including favouring a hard line against the Soviet Union and the backing of the Contras in Nicaragua. Re-elected to Congress with an overwhelming majority in 1984, he was asked to serve on the influential House Foreign Affairs Committee, which further raised his profile.In 1987, he entered the Senate to represent Arizona, replacing the arch-conservative Barry Goldwater who had retired. His expertise in the Navy led to a seat on the Senate Armed Forces Committee. He also served on the Indian Affairs Committee where, as a keen gambler himself, he pushed through new laws that allowed native Americans to generate revenue from casinos.McCain had already established a reputation of not being afraid to challenge his own party leadership. He caused a stir when he twice supported President Clinton's nominees for the Supreme Court, judging them to be the best people for the job.In the early 90s, the new senator was involved in a corruption scandal after he and four Democratic senators were accused of trying to intimidate regulators on behalf of a campaign donor who eventually served prison time for corrupt management practices. He received a mild warning after an investigation found he \"exercised poor judgment in intervening with the regulators\" but that his actions \"were not improper\". McCain announced he was running for the Republican nomination for president in September 1999.He pitched himself as the anti-establishment candidate against fellow candidate, Texas Governor George W Bush, who could rely on most of the support - and the money - from the party hierarchy. In what became a bitter campaign, Bush proved adept at harnessing the support of the Christian right and McCain, after a heavy defeat on so-called Super Tuesday, quit the race in March 2000.While he pledged his support for Bush, McCain characteristically showed he was not afraid to criticise the new president. He was one of only two Republican senators to vote against tax cuts and also opposed the president's policies on gun control. However, after the 9/11 attacks he supported Bush's war in Afghanistan and the invasion of Iraq, although as the latter operation dragged on, he began to question the Bush strategy and the policies of the US defence secretary, Donald Rumsfeld.In April 2007, McCain announced he would again run for president and fought off a strong challenge from New York mayor Rudy Giuliani and the Massachusetts governor Mitt Romney for the Republican nomination. Mindful of his need to attract support from conservative Christians, he surprised everyone by announcing virtually unknown Sarah Palin, the governor of Alaska, as his running mate.But while Palin's hockey mum persona was welcomed by the right, mainstream voters began to question her lack of experience and a series of poor performances in TV interviews cast doubts on the credibility of the Republican campaign.Outspent by the Obama campaign, and carrying the legacy of eight years of a Bush presidency, McCain lost both the electoral college and the popular vote and Obama entered the White House.Unusually, the relationship between the two men seemed to blossom after the election and Obama often consulted McCain. However, the senator came out strongly in opposition to the new president's plans to stimulate the economy, claiming it was money spent to no useful purpose.Back in Arizona, he fought off a challenge by a Tea Party candidate and easily retained his Senate seat in the 2010 elections. His profile in the Senate remained high and his regular appearances on US TV maintained his position as one of the best known politicians in the US.When Republicans began selecting their presidential candidate for the 2016 election, McCain expressed grave doubts over Donald Trump's suitability for the job, once referring to a roomful of Trump supporters as \"crazies\".The relationship between the two men took a further knock when Trump criticised McCain's war record.\"He's not a war hero,\" Trump opined. \"He's a war hero because he was captured? I like people who weren't captured.\"McCain withdrew his support for Trump in October 2016, the day after a 2005 recording emerged of Trump making obscene remarks about women and appearing to admit to sexual assault.\"When Mr Trump attacks women and demeans the women in our nation and in our society, that is a point where I just have to part company,\" he said.However, Trump, along with Barack Obama, was among the first to offer good wishes to McCain when, in July 2017, it was announced that he was suffering with a brain tumour.The same month - while sporting a scar over his left eye after surgery for a blood clot - he dramatically used a \"thumbs down\" to vote against a Republican health care repeal bill. The president tweeted that McCain, and other senators who voted against the bill, had \"let the American people down\".John McCain's determination to plot his own political course, regardless of the party line, probably explains why he never reached the highest office in US politics. But he was seen as a man of principle, someone happy to sit down with his political opponents if there was a compromise to be reached. \"I will work with anyone to get this country moving again,\" he once said. \"I will listen to any idea that is offered in good faith and intended to help solve our problems.\"",

            "content": "According to United Nations figures, 2.3 million people left Venezuela between 2014 and up to June 2018. Thousands continue to flee.With 7% of the population having left nearly every family has been affected. Development charity Cafod, which forms part of Caritas International, has spoken to some of those left behind. A retired seamstress and mother of nine, María Teresa Jiménez has watched five of her children and nine of her grandchildren leave Venezuela.\"I worked for 38 years as a seamstress, and it went very well, my children wanted for nothing. Now, we don't even have money for medicine,\" she says of the shortages which have hit Venezuela for the past years. \"Fortunately, I didn't have my children now, I had them at a time when they could succeed. \"I'm happy that my children are in a place where they don't face danger. I wish I were 20 years younger, so I could go with them.\"Magaly Henríquez is a mother of five. She has stayed behind while her two youngest children, María Eugenia, a special education teacher, and Junior, a businessman, have immigrated.  \"It is really painful,\" says Ms Henríquez. \"My son had so many dreams. He started a paint supply business (which was forced to close due to rising prices). My daughter was working two jobs, and that wasn't enough for her to survive here. Many of the teachers in Venezuela had to leave.\"Junior has now found work in Peru as a physical trainer and María Eugenia works as a housekeeper.\"I grew up in a free Venezuela,\" says Ms Henríquez \"We didn't have these limitations with money. We could afford things. We had what we needed to live.\"Ms Pérez has been caring for her grandchildren Naile, 12, Naiberli, 7 and Naire, 13, for a month, after her daughter went to seek work in Colombia. \"She'd been looking for work for over two years and nothing. I told her to take advantage of the fact I still have the strength to look after them,\" says Ms Pérez.\"It's hard on the girls. They've had birthdays, graduations and their mum isn't there. But when she calls they just tell her not to worry that they are fine and love her very much.\" School enrolment is fast approaching, and registration requires that each child submits ID photos. The photographs cost a little more than a quarter of the average monthly salary.If she doesn't get the images taken the girls will not be able to go to school.Fr Cristóbal Domínguez has seen a mass exodus of youth from his parish - in the first half of the year, 17 youth ministry members migrated.\"We suffered the loss of the entire parish choir, which was made up of young adults who migrated last December,\" he says.  \"We're now trying to form a new choir, but the topic of conversation is always about what other countries they can go to, which one offers more opportunities.\"Sadly, many of them feel that to find brighter horizons their only option is to migrate.\"Working alongside Caritas Venezuela, Fr Cristóbal's parish runs an \"olla comunitaria\", a soup kitchen providing food for more than 500 people every week. With the new school year only weeks away, he fears that many classes will be without teachers as they will have migrated.   All photographs by Caritas International.",

            "title": "Lula: Brazil's jailed ex-leader barred from presidential race by electoral court",
            "content": "Brazil's top electoral court has ruled that jailed former President Luiz Inácio Lula da Silva cannot run as a candidate in the presidential election because of his corruption conviction. Judges voted against his running in October's ballot by a majority of six votes to one in the seven-member court. Lula, 72, was leading in polls ahead of the vote despite serving a 12-year jail term for accepting a bribe. His legal team has said they will appeal against the court's decision.Brazil's Workers' Party (PT) later responded to the court's decision in a statement, saying it would \"fight by all means\" for Lula's candidacy.\"We will present all appeals before the courts for the recognition of the rights of Lula provided by law and international treaties ratified by Brazil,\" the statement said, adding: \"We will defend Lula in the streets, with the people.\"Lula's conviction for money laundering and corruption was upheld in January. In Brazil, no one convicted of a crime upheld on appeal can run for office.However, exceptions have been made to the law before.In declaring Lula ineligible to stand on Friday, one judge said: \"What is at stake here today is the equality of all citizens before the law and the Constitution.\"Lula was convicted of receiving a renovated beachfront apartment worth some 3.7m reais ($1.1m; £790,000) as a bribe by engineering firm OAS.He denied wrongdoing and said his conviction was part of a plot to prevent him returning to power.The former president is the most high-profile person convicted in the sweeping Operation Car Wash anti-corruption investigation. Despite his jail sentence, PT voted to nominate Lula as its candidate last month. Lula reportedly chose Fernando Haddad, former mayor of São Paulo, to run for the PT should he be prevented from doing so.Serving as president from 2003 to 2011, Lula presided over a surge in economic growth and major social programmes that left him with an 87% approval rating on leaving office.But the former leader surrendered to police in April after his corruption conviction.An appeal in January not only saw the court uphold his original conviction, but also increase the length of the sentence by two-and-a-half years.Before Friday's court judgement on whether he could run, Brazil's prosecutor general filed to bar his candidacy due to the law prohibiting those who have lost appeals against their conviction from standing.Despite this, recent polls reportedly showed that around one-third of Brazilians would back Lula if he were allowed to run, which would make him the front-runner in October's vote.

            "title": "Why Australia is talking about a French au pair",
            "content": "An Australian minister is facing growing questions over why he personally intervened to grant a visa to a French au pair, in a case that has attracted national attention.Home Affairs Minister Peter Dutton denies he acted improperly in halting the deportation of Alexandra Deuwel.The decision helped a wealthy family, and followed a plea by their relative - a prominent sporting chief executive.Local media said Mr Dutton had overruled a senior official's advice.Critics have compared the case to Mr Dutton's unwavering commitment, as immigration minister, to keeping asylum seekers in overseas detention - a long-time controversial policy.Mr Dutton failed in two attempts to become prime minister last week, ultimately losing out to Scott Morrison.Ms Deuwel, 27, had her tourist visa cancelled on arrival in Australia in 2015, on suspicions that she had intended to work.However, Mr Dutton used his ministerial discretion to reverse the decision. Ms Deuwel had previously worked for pastoralists Callum and Skye MacLachlan in South Australia. Their relative, Australian Football League boss Gillon McLachlan (who uses an alternative spelling), had lobbied Mr Dutton to intervene in Ms Deuwel's case.Adding to public scrutiny, Callum MacLachlan's father, Hugh, has donated about A$150,000 (£84,000; $110,000) to the governing Liberal Party since 1999, local media reported.Mr Dutton's decision to grant a visa to at least one other au pair is already the subject of a Senate inquiry.On Thursday, the minister strongly rejected any suggestion that the MacLachlan family had influenced his decision.He said he had assessed Ms Deuwel's case on its merits, telling radio 2GB that she had no criminal history and had agreed not to work in Australia.\"I thought it was an application of common sense,\" he said.Mr Dutton has not responded to reports that an Australian Border Force official warned him in 2015 that some evidence \"does not support the Minister intervening\".Aside from scrutiny of the case specifically, observers have pointed out that it has only become public now - days after Mr Dutton's failed leadership bids.\"It suggests that somebody behind the scenes is trying to do as much damage as they possibly can to Peter Dutton in circumstances where he's obviously been in the headlines,\" ABC political correspondent Laura Tingle said on Tuesday.But it has also ignited allegations of double-standards on visa issues: among those angered are supporters of a Tamil family involved in a high-profile effort to stay in Australia.The family, who have lived for years in Queensland, are now facing deportation - despite a petition to Mr Dutton that gathered almost 120,000 signatures.Others have made similar comparisons about Australia's policy of sending asylum seekers who arrive by boat to Nauru and Papua New Guinea. The policy has been criticised by human rights groups as inhumane. Recently, it has been reported that child asylum seekers in particular have been struggling acutely with mental illness.#Dutton has steadfastly refused to give 'ministerial approval' to  children on #Nauru desperately in need of critical medical attention but issues a visa to an AU Pair on humanitarian grounds for the benefit of  the rich and powerful. UNBELIEVABLE #HYPOCRISY! #Auspol pic.twitter.com/ywWz7rIM6VEnd of Twitter post  by @FrBowerAustralia argues its offshore detention policy is necessary to disrupt human trafficking and save lives at sea.",

Dozens of other people are reported to have been wounded.Human Rights Watch condemned the violence and said that at least 18 of the dead were civilians, among them four children.Hundreds of migrants trapped by the fighting have been moved to other detention centres, while the city's airport was closed for two days on Friday.Libya has faced continuing chaos since Nato-backed forces overthrew long-serving ruler Col Muammar Gaddafi in October 2011, with rival political forces in the east and west and powerful armed militias across the country.",

            "title": "Why you can't talk about John Oliver in China",
            "content": "If you're looking to post something about John Oliver on Chinese social media this week, chances are you can't.The British television host been censored on China's biggest social media site, just days after he criticised Chinese President Xi Jinping on his popular US show Last Week Tonight.In the show's latest episode, Mr Oliver highlights the political, human rights and economic issues China is currently facing, and delivers some striking criticisms of the Chinese government. Attempts by the BBC to post a status on Weibo - China's biggest social media platform - with the term \"John Oliver\" were blocked. Instead an error message pops up, informing you that the post violates \"relevant laws and regulations\".If you try searching for \"John Oliver\", it does yield some results, though you won't find any new posts - the most recent one is from the 12 June, a week before the \"Last Week Tonight\" episode aired.A search for the show's name in Mandarin also brings up no results.In the 20-minute episode, the host touches on some topics that are known to be controversial in China.He mentions China's removal of presidential term limits, which has essentially allowed President Xi to remain in power for life, adding that Mr Xi has \"gone out of his way to form a cult of personality\".The removal of presidential terms was highly criticised and online censors had then rushed to block discussion around the topic.Mr Oliver also brings up China's treatment of the Uighurs, a Muslim minority who live primarily in the region of Xinjiang and say they have long faced discrimination. The Chinese government blames bloody clashes on Islamist militants and separatists. In recent years China has introduced new restrictions on the Uighur people.The TV host also mentions Liu Xiaobo, one of China's most prominent human rights advocates and a Nobel peace prize laureate.Mr Liu, who died in 2017 at the age of 61, had been serving an 11-year prison term for subversion and was branded a criminal by authorities. Social media posts about Mr Liu have similarly been censored on Weibo, with Mr Oliver saying himself that: \"Chinese media won't allow mentions of [his] name.\"His wife, Liu Xia, is still held under house arrest by Chinese authorities, and is said to be suffering from depression after spending years under heavy surveillance.\"Xi's crackdown on human rights is apparently the harshest crackdown since Tiananmen square,\" said Mr Oliver in his video. \"[He] has clamped down noticeably on any form of dissident whatsoever.\"It is not uncommon for whole phrases or terms to be censored on Chinese social media. As Mr Oliver points out in his video, the Chinese name for Winnie the Pooh and pictures of the cuddly character were blocked on Weibo after bloggers continually compared him to China's president. China employs millions of people to monitor and censor internet activity and posts deemed to be politically incorrect are routinely deleted. Last Week Tonight is not officially available on Chinese television and YouTube remains blocked in China but clips of the show are available on Chinese video hosting platforms.",

            "title": "From 'alternative facts' to rewriting history in Trump's White House",
            "content": "It is time we sit and talk about truth and transparency. Every now and then a few disparate things collide, and suddenly you see a pattern. And I don't want this blog to come across as faux naïve. I've covered politics for long enough to know that politicians will try to shape and mould truth to best suit their purposes, to allow them to weaponise the facts that will give them greatest advantage. And I know that politicians love transparency when it best suits them. But in the past two weeks, a line has been crossed. Let me start with something seemingly minor. I was listening to the president and Theresa May at their news conference in the Chequers garden when Donald Trump, talking about Brexit, suddenly made the statement that he had predicted the result when he was at his golf course in Turnberry for the opening of his wonderful golf course the day before the EU referendum in June 2016. I sat up with a jolt. I had been there with him on that trip. We didn't arrive until the day after the referendum. He wasn't there on June 22nd. He was there on June 24th. I pointed this out on Twitter, saying it was a bit bizarre. Now I can see as a bit of storytelling it works better to claim to have been the visionary who saw what was coming; I can also see that when you're 72-years-old you might misremember dates and times. Who doesn't do that occasionally? - although maybe not on something as fundamental as that. Anyway back to my tweet saying the president was factually incorrect. Straight back shot Stephanie Grisham, who is the first lady's director of communications, but more importantly at the time was Donald Trump's press person for the trip to Turnberry. She told me on Twitter the president was right to say what he had said - and she had the photos to prove it. Content is not availableSo we produced the tweet from the president on the 24th saying \"Just arrived in Scotland…\" and from her saying that she had just arrived in Scotland. Someone else found the flight manifest, confirming that the Trump private jet had arrived on the 24th. I fully agree a storm in a teacup. This is not the sort of thing on which world peace hinges. But I struggle to fathom Steph's motives. Why did she go wading in to defend a lie? And why when the proof was provided that she was incorrect did she not just say \"fair enough - my mistake\". Content is not availablePsychology has a rather good word for this - \"gaslighting\". This is the Wikipedia definition of it: Gaslighting is a form of psychological manipulation that seeks to sow seeds of doubt in a targeted individual or in members of a targeted group, making them question their own memory, perception, and sanity. Using persistent denial, misdirection, contradiction, and lying, it attempts to destabilise the victim and delegitimise the victim's belief.From Chequers we now go to Helsinki, and another extraordinary news conference this time with Vladimir Putin. The whole thing was slightly surreal, made more so by the guy sitting next to me being yanked out by the Secret Service after it became clear to them he was planning some kind of protest during the news conference. During the course of the Q and A, Jeff Mason from Reuters was called to ask a question. He wanted to know whether Putin had wanted Donald Trump to win the 2016 presidential election and had directed any of his officials to help him do that?Vladimir Putin didn't hesitate: \"Yes, I wanted him to win because he talked about bringing the US-Russia relationship back to normal.\"It was quite a moment. But then I saw a tweet that Donald Trump put out yesterday to protest about how tough he was with Russia, which read:\"I'm very concerned that Russia will be fighting very hard to have an impact on the upcoming Election. Based on the fact that no President has been tougher on Russia than me, they will be pushing very hard for the Democrats. They definitely don't want Trump!\"So I referred back to what Putin had said in Helsinki a week earlier. But here's where it gets super murky. All reference to that exchange between Mr Mason and the Russian leader has been omitted from the official White House transcript. In the official record it doesn't exist. Just a clerical transcription error? Well maybe - there is some confusion over the translation, but maybe it would be good to correct the record. Now for another random event which happened yesterday. The White House has said that it will no longer provide information about when the president holds conversations with foreign leaders, as it has always done hitherto. The accounts of the chats may have been anodyne and terse, but they were a useful tool to keep track of foreign policy priorities. And it was always useful to compare and contrast what, say, the Kremlin would have to say about the conversation compared to the White House. Now we will no longer be able to do that. And so to the final thing. Donald Trump was speaking at a rally in Kansas City. And he came out with a memorable phrase that sounded as though it had been lifted straight from George Orwell's dystopian novel, 1984. He said: \"Just remember, what you are seeing and what you are reading is not what's happening.\" Or it is. There is just a concerted - and sometimes it would seem - systematic effort to make you think otherwise. Forget alternative facts. This is rewriting history.",

On Sunday, Colombia is going to try something different. Voters will head to the polls in a referendum that its supporters hope will bring about tougher anti-corruption legislation.But even though polls suggest that corruption is Colombians' top concern a \"yes\" vote is not a foregone conclusion by any means.Voters will be asked whether they agree to seven measures:1. A pay cap limiting salaries of members of Congress to 25 times the national minimum wage2. That individuals convicted of corruption serve their full sentence in jail3. That public entities be open and transparent when hiring contractors 4. Letting citizens have a say on the budget5.

To restrict elected officials to three terms in the same legislative bodyThe referendum is binding but it is only valid if a third of all voters take part - just over 12 million.For each individual measure to be adopted, it needs to receive 50% of valid votes plus one.Congress then has one year to turn the measures into law and make them legally binding. If that does not happen, the president has 15 days to do so through a decree.Non-governmental organisation Transparency for Colombia, says some of the proposed measures would go some way towards rebalancing the ethical relationship between elected officials and the people.But the country's prosecutor-general, Nestor Humberto Martinez, said the steps were \"limited and insufficient\". He has called on President Iván Duque to appoint special anti-corruption judges to handle the growth in the number of corruption cases. Senator Claudia López - one of the proponents of the referendum - argues that the initiative was \"not intended as the sole solution against corruption\".\"We need political-electoral reform and judicial reform. But [the referendum] is a start,\" she said.All parties say they support fighting corruption - the referendum bill cleared the Senate with an impressive 84-0 vote. However, six out of the seven questions had previously been introduced in Congress and defeated in the lower chamber.Germán Manga, a columnist with weekly Semana, has called the questions \"irrelevant, anodyne, almost childish\".He says most of the measures proposed are already covered by current laws.Joaquín Vélez Navarro, a columnist with El Tiempo, has branded the proposals \"pure populism\".His criticism of the referendum includes an attack on the measure to cut the salaries of state officials - which in his view could backfire.\"Such a law could generate incentives for some officials to 'adjust their salaries' through corruption. Or they could put off honest people from dedicating their professional life to public service.\"President Iván Duque entirely eschewed the issue in his inauguration speech on 7 August.Two days later, he presented to Congress a package of four legislative bills aimed at fighting corruption - three of which were included in the points of the referendum.Mr Duque now says he will vote on Sunday - but his governing Democratic Centre party is not actively campaigning for it.Supporters of the referendum want voters to come out in numbers exceeding 15 million. But that turnout will not be easy to achieve.Last June, 19.5 million - or 53% of voters - took part in the second round of presidential elections but turnout at elections tends to draw many more voters than referenda.Meanwhile, Colombian social media is awash with fake news aimed at undermining the vote.One widely circulated myth is that the proposal to lower the salaries of members of Congress would result in a pay cut for ordinary Colombians and pensioners.\"Many [people] are trying to discredit the referendum with fake news,\" Ms López tweeted. \"Do not believe in lies!\"She has urged voters to come out to support the proposals.\"The referendum would be unnecessary if they didn't steal 50 trillion [Colombian pesos] from us.\"",

Earlier this year, tens of thousands of women protested against hidden cameras, carrying signs with messages like \"my life is not your porn\".Activists say women live in constant fear of being photographed or filmed without their knowledge.About 80% of the victims of spy camera porn are women.Seoul's public toilets are currently only inspected for hidden cameras about once a month, Yonhap news agency reports.However, staff who maintain the toilets will now also be required to check them for spy cameras daily.Law enforcement officials have previously told the BBC that it is difficult to catch perpetrators - especially as they can install cameras, and take them down again within 15 minutes. While more than 5,400 people were arrested for spy camera related crimes last year, fewer than 2% of those held were jailed.Yonhap says that the 50 government employees tasked specifically with finding hidden cameras have not discovered any for two years.",

            "content": "Some 400 prisoners have escaped from a facility near the Libyan capital Tripoli amid deadly violence between militia groups in the city, police say. \"The detainees were able to force open the doors\" in order to leave the Ain Zara prison, the local police said.They added that guards, fearing for their lives, were unable to prevent the breakout following riots at the jail. Clashes between militias in the city have led Libya's UN-backed government to declare a state of emergency.The incident on Sunday took place during armed violence between rival factions around the facility, which houses only male inmates.Many of the prisoners held at the Ain Zara prison in south-east Tripoli were reportedly supporters of the late Libyan leader Muammar Gaddafi, and had been found guilty of killings during the uprising against his government in 2011.Separately on Sunday, two people were killed and several others were injured when rockets hit a camp in Libya's capital housing hundreds of displaced people, according to emergency services and witnesses.Libya's Ministry of Health reports that some 47 people, including civilians, have died in rival militia clashes in Tripoli over the past week, with dozens more injured.A UN-backed government is nominally in power in the capital, but militias occupy much of the rest of the country.The violence broke out last week when militias from a city to the south of Tripoli attacked southern areas, leading to fighting with local militias that support the internationally recognised government, the Government of National Accord (GNA).The GNA has described the clashes as \"an attempt to derail peaceful political transition\" in the country, adding that it \"could not remain silent over the attacks on Tripoli and its suburbs, which is a violation of security in the capital and of citizens' safety\".Human Rights Watch has also condemned the violence, adding that at least 18 of the dead were reportedly civilians, among them four children.Hundreds of migrants trapped by the fighting have been moved to other detention centres, while the city's airport was closed for two days on Friday.Libya has faced continuing chaos since Nato-backed militia forces, some of them rivals, overthrew long-serving ruler Colonel Gaddafi in October 2011.UN Secretary General Antonio Guterres has said the \"indiscriminate use of force is a violation of international humanitarian and human rights law\" and has urged \"all parties to grant humanitarian relief for those in need\".On Saturday, the US, UK, France and Italy called for an immediate end to deadly violence in Libya's capital.A joint statement said attempts \"to weaken the legitimate Libyan authorities and hinder the ongoing political process are not acceptable\".\"We are calling on the armed groups to immediately stop all military action and warn those who seek to undermine stability, in Tripoli or elsewhere in Libya, that they will be made accountable for it,\" the joint statement read.However successive attempts at a truce have so far failed to stop the fierce fighting between several militias.

            "title": "Letter from Africa: Heroes and villains of Nigeria's parliament siege",
            "content": "In our series of letters from Africa, Nigerian writer and novelist Adaobi Tricia Nwaubani says scenes resembling a coup in her country have left many scratching their heads.Nigerians still can't say for sure why armed, masked men held our country's parliament under siege last week. But the alarming incident had a most joyous ending.They blocked all entrances to the building, denying lawmakers, civil servants and journalists access.It turned out they were operatives of the state's spy agency, the Department of State Security (DSS), headed by Lawal Daura.  The other man at the centre of the drama is Senate President Bukola Saraki, who recently defected from the ruling APC party to the main opposition PDP.He had called a parliamentary meeting of national assembly leaders - and it was this group that the armed men were blocking.One theory is that it was a strong-arm tactic to make Mr Saraki resign so that the APC can appoint a ruling party senate president in his place.The other theory is that it was all staged to make it appear as if it was officially sanctioned to make the government look bad.Neither theory stands up to logical scrutiny, but you should never let anything surprise when it comes to the antics of Nigerian politics.In April, a disgruntled MP allegedly organised for intruders to storm the Senate and steal its mace.Decisions in the upper chamber cannot be approved without the mace - a large ornamental staff that represents the legislature's authority. But when news spread of the events last week, including videos of angry lawmakers in confrontation with the armed state operatives, even Nigerians expressed their condemnation.   President Muhammadu Buhari was away in the UK on vacation, leaving his deputy Yemi Osinbajo in charge. Adaobi Tricia Nwaubani:\"Nothing about Yemi Osinbajo excites the usual comedy that Nigerians have come to expect from our leaders\"\"Nigeria is a democracy not a military dictatorship,\" said Atiku Abubakar, a former vice-president and PDP presidential hopeful.\"The acting president, being himself a professor of law, ought to know that setting such a precedent is an invitation to anarchy.\"And indeed it was Mr Osinbajo who became the hero of the day. Not only is Mr Osinbajo a professor of law and a former commissioner for justice, he is arguably one of the most distinguished leaders to have graced the Nigerian seat of power in the past few decades.For starters, nothing about him excites the usual comedy that Nigerians have come to expect from our leaders.His educational qualifications are without suspicion. His foot does not get jammed in his mouth each time he speaks. He has no known girlfriends flaunting flashy cars and shady contracts around the capital city, Abuja. He has no known cadavers stinking in his cupboard.   Mr Osinbajo has even been heard to apologise after arriving late at events. The typical Nigerian public office holder's self-importance can usually be measured by how long they can keep people waiting.And the vice-president did not disappoint. While the siege was ongoing, he released a statement denouncing it as \"condemnable and completely unacceptable\". Then he announced the immediate dismissal of Mr Daura - and the masked men were recalled to their lair. Again, Nigerians can't say for sure if Mr Daura was simply a scapegoat for a failed coup, or if he was indeed acting without presidential authority, motivated by his loyalty to Mr Buhari, his kinsman from the village of Daura in Katsina state, north-western Nigeria. But, I promised you a happy ending, didn't I? Many Nigerians feel that if it took the siege on parliament to be finally rid of the spy chief - then hurray.In 2015, the sexagenarian was exhumed from retirement and appointed to head the DSS. In the past three years of Mr Daura's leadership, the agency has been characterised by midnight arrests on those suspected of corruption, disdain for court orders, detention of a journalist without trial, and the harassing of lawmakers at a federal and state level.Many Nigerians feared that as he came from Mr Buhari's hometown it had made him untouchable.We had resigned ourselves to the ongoing nightmare.But, as the saying goes: he whom the gods wish to destroy, they first make mad. The madness that Mr Daura seemed to display by launching the siege has now led to his ignominious fall.On the acting president's orders, Mr Daura was arrested and although released a few days later, his passport was seized. Mr Osinbajo described his antics as \"a gross violation of constitutional order, rule of law and all accepted notions of law and order\". Mr Daura has yet to put his side of events.But many Nigerians are now hoping that he will have that opportunity in court. What an even more joyous ending that would be - and one that follows the rule of law. Follow us on Twitter @BBCAfrica, on Facebook at BBC Africa or on Instagram at bbcafrica",

            "title": "Australia abuse inquiry: Catholic Church rejects call to overhaul confession",
            "content": "The Catholic Church in Australia has formally rejected a landmark inquiry's recommendation that priests should be forced to report sexual abuse disclosed during confession.The five-year inquiry found tens of thousands of children had suffered abuse in Australian institutions. The Catholic Church had the most cases.On Friday, Church leaders accepted most of the inquiry's recommendations.But their stance on confession may set up future conflict with governments.The Australian Catholic Bishops Conference said breaking the seal of confession was \"contrary to our faith and inimical to religious liberty\".\"We are committed to the safeguarding of children and vulnerable people while maintaining the seal,\" it said in a statement.The Church leaders said they would, however, explore other proposals - including asking the Vatican to relax rules on celibacy.The royal commission inquiry, which concluded in December, heard more than 8,000 testimonies about abuse in churches, schools and sports clubs.2559allegations referred to police since the inquiry began in 2013230 prosecutions have commenced 41,770 calls received from members of the public 60,000 survivors may be eligible for compensation, estimates say Its final report made more than 400 recommendations across government and other institutional sectors. The government called the abuse a \"national tragedy\", began a compensation scheme for survivors, and said it would give a national apology on 22 October.Religious ministers and schoolteachers were found to be the most common perpetrators. The inquiry heard they included 7% of Australia's Catholic priests between 1950 and 2010.The commissioners recommended that Catholic clerics should face criminal charges if they failed to report sexual abuse disclosed to them during confession.It also said the Catholic Church should consider making celibacy voluntary for priests because while it was \"not a direct cause of child sexual abuse\", it had \"contributed to the occurrence of child sexual abuse, especially when combined with other risk factors\".The Catholic Church had already opted in to the compensation scheme, which will give survivors payments of up to A$150,000 (£85,000; $110,000) each.However, Church leaders have consistently ruled out making changes to confession.Additionally, they asserted that new rules would make perpetrators or victims less likely to disclose abuse during confession.But they vowed to end the cover-up of abuse - echoing recent statements by the Pope - and committed to several actions, including:Archbishop of Brisbane Mark Coleridge said there was a \"dark side\" to mandatory celibacy, but conceded that the Holy See was unlikely to act quickly, if at all, in making significant changes.The state of South Australia has already unveiled new laws - to take effect in October - that will legally compel clergy to report abuse.However, Church leaders have vowed not to adhere to it. State officials say this may lead to prosecutions, resulting in fines of up to A$10,000 (£5,570; $7,250).In June, Victoria's attorney-general, Martin Pakula, said other states were working \"to develop a nationally consistent approach on this important issue\".",

            "title": "Russia's Putin embraces higher pension age but softens blow",
            "content": "For a long time Vladimir Putin distanced himself from Russia's pension reform. It was always expected to be highly controversial and the idea was for the government to propose the tough reform and take the flak. But the street protests grew and President Putin's approval rating fell, regardless. So now, as if on cue, he has ridden to the rescue - cast as Vladimir the Benevolent, stepping in to soften the blow.Any notion that he would simply scrap the reform, or overhaul it significantly, was soon scotched.From the start of his speech, simulcast on all state TV channels, Mr Putin went to great lengths to explain that raising the retirement age was essential. Acknowledging that he had once promised never to take this step as president, he argued that times - and the economic environment - had changed. Too many pensioners and too few workers were putting an intolerable pressure on state finances. If nothing changed, the president warned, the system would first crack and then collapse.His tone veered from kindly and sympathetic - calling viewers his \"dear friends\" and stressing that he shared their concern - to stern. \"We really can't delay any more,\" Mr Putin insisted. \"That would be irresponsible.\"#Putin: this pension reform cannot be put off. If we don’t show decisiveness now, the stability of society will be threatened and so the security of our country. I ask for your understanding pic.twitter.com/VGEYA3qGQAEnd of Twitter post  by @sarahrainsfordHe cast pension reform as a matter of national security. The president did offer some mild relief from the initial proposal for Russian women. As Russia \"cares\" for its women, he said, they would have to work only five extra years before retirement at 60, instead of eight. That can be cut further, mind you, if they have extra children - basically producing extra workers to contribute to the pension pot.On the other hand, those mothers will probably have to stay at home to care for their bigger brood. At the moment, many grandmothers help raise children once they retire at 55. Under the new system, they would be working.But the biggest bone of contention is male workers. Vladimir Putin left the new retirement age for men at 65, a five-year increase. His argument is that life expectancy has leapt up under his rule, which is certainly true compared to the dire post-Soviet crisis of the 1990s. But Russian men still only live to 67 on average. Under the new system a huge number would not survive to collect their pension. More money, then, for that \"cracking\" system.The Kremlin says Mr Putin has intervened on this issue because of its importance, not to boost his flagging rating. His spokesman, Dmitry Peskov, told the BBC it was a \"brave step, in Putin's style\" and state TV has now gone into overdrive promoting it and the pension reform. However, supporters of opposition politician Alexei Navalny have reacted to the speech by posting fresh calls to a protest on 9 September. Mr Navalny himself was sentenced to 30 days in custody this week, a step he argues was meant to hinder preparations for rallies against the reform across the country.And on the streets, Russians' initial reaction has been cool. One woman, Irina, blamed foreign policy and sanctions for the lack of cash in the pension pot. A man called Sergei said he feared there would be no money at all by the time he reached retirement. The risk for Russia's president, of course, is that while this unpopular move could once be pinned firmly on the government - it's now very much Vladimir Putin's proposal. ",

            "title": "Why is Libya so lawless?",
            "content": "Libya has been beset by chaos since Nato-backed forces overthrew long-serving ruler Col Muammar Gaddafi in October 2011. Western powers are now becoming increasingly concerned that so-called Islamic State (IS) has built a presence in the North African state and the US has responded by launching air strikes on the militant group. Only Libya's myriad armed militias really wield power - and it is felt they often hold the politicians they supposedly back to ransom.During the uprising, anyone with a gun could command respect, and lots of armed groups emerged - up to 1,700, according to some estimates.There are two rival parliaments and three governments - the latest government was formed in UN-brokered talks with the aim of replacing the other two. But this initiative is still on the rocks, partly because of concerns that the new government is being imposed by Western powers. The oil-rich country once had one of the highest standards of living in Africa, with free healthcare and free education, but six years on from the uprising, it is facing a financial crisis.This turmoil has allowed IS to gain a foothold in the country.Top IS leaders 'take refuge' in LibyaIS had taken control of an \"enclave\" in and around the city of Sirte, the birthplace of Gaddafi. Security experts feared this could provide a safe haven for jihadists to train, fund and plan attacks in North Africa and across the Mediterranean.However, pro-government forces backed by the West have now pushed back the Islamists and retaken the city.Some security analysts describe Libya as an arms bazaar. It is awash with weapons looted from Gaddafi's arsenal - making an ideal playground for jihadists fleeing air strikes in Syria and Iraq.IS has been attacking Libyan oil facilities, has kidnapped several foreign oil workers and in 2015 was behind two high-profile attacks on Tunisia's tourism industry - carried out by gunmen trained in Libya.Tunisia has built a partial security barrier and trench along its border with Libya aimed at preventing further atrocities.Beheadings and racial tension: Life under Islamic StateHow IS's Libya foothold threatens UKThe Libyans gaining ground on ISThe US has carried out at least four known air strikes in Libya since 2015. The latest one, in January, targeted an alleged training camp on the outskirts of Sirte where some IS militants had fled after the city fell. The UK and France also have special forces operating in the North African state - the nature and extent of these operations have largely been secretive.Three French soldiers died in July 2016 when their helicopter was shot down by militiamen who identified themselves as belonging to a new militant group called Benghazi Defence Brigades (BDB).  Last year, plans were unveiled to send 6,000 troops from a number of Nato countries, including the UK and France, to Libya to train local troops to stop IS-linked groups from gaining more territory and to provide security to diplomatic missions that were looking to move back to the capital. However, the new unity government was reluctant to openly allow or request such a presence and the plan has still not materialised.Former US President Barack Obama, in an interview published in April 2016, said that the \"worst mistake\" of his presidency was the failure to prepare for the aftermath of Col Gaddafi's overthrow.  He partly blamed then-UK Prime Minister David Cameron for \"the mess\", saying he had not done enough to support the North African nation whose instability was threatening its neighbours and was a factor in Europe's migrant crisis.Parliamentary elections held in 2014 were disputed. Those who held power refused to give it up and remained in the capital, Tripoli.The newly elected parliament then moved to the port of Tobruk, 1,000km (620 miles) away and set up a rival government. This parliament still has the official backing of the UN as Libya's official legislative body - despite the fact that it is opposed to the new unity administration. It wants Gen Khalifa Haftar, who is leading the battle against Islamist militias, to keep a senior role in a future army, something the UN agreement does not guarantee.The UN-mediated deal for a unity government has seen the formation of a nine-member Presidency Council, led by Prime Minister Fayez Sarraj. He arrived in Tripoli in March 2016 to set up his administration and has been trying to win the support of the various militias and politicians, but it has little real power over the whole country.The council has also suffered from divisions. Two members boycotted it continuously, eventually moving to the east, while another member resigned.Mr Sarraj, an engineer by profession, approved the 1 August 2016 US air strike on suspected IS positions in Sirte, in the first co-ordinated military action between his government and the US.Has Libya pulled back from the brink?They were united in their hatred for Gaddafi - but nothing more. There was no single group in charge of the rebellion. Militias were based in different cities, fighting their own battles. They are also ideologically divided - some of them are militant or moderate Islamists, others are secessionists or monarchists and yet others are liberals. Furthermore, the militias are split along regional, ethnic and local lines, making it a combustible mix. And after more than four decades of authoritarian rule, they had little understanding of democracy. So they were unable to forge compromises and build a new state based on the rule of law. My search for Gaddafi's golden gunEast and central:West:Guide to Libya's militiasProfile: Khalifa HaftarRogue general divides LibyansOil production almost ground to a halt for more than two years but has recovered a little in recent months. This happened after a siege was lifted by LNA forces when they took over the main oil fields in central Libya and expelled a rival armed group led by Ibrahim Jathran. Banks are still strapped for cash, however, and there is little foreign currency available officially. The black market exchange rate has sky-rocketed in recent months, and food prices have risen.  Hospitals are in short supply of medicine.An estimated 400,000 Libyans are also internally displaced.",

            "content": " A Yazidi teenager sold into slavery by Islamic State has told the BBC of her horror after she escaped to Germany, only to come face-to-face with her captor in the street.Ashwaq was only 14 when Islamic State fighters stormed into northern Iraq, including the heartland of the Yazidi people. They took thousands of women as sex slaves, including Ashwaq - sold for $100 to a man named Abu Humam.Raped and beaten, she managed to escape three months later and then went to Germany with her mother and one brother.A few months ago, on the street outside a supermarket, she heard someone call out her name.Ashwaq told the BBC: \"On the way back to school a car pulled up next to me. He was sitting in the front seat. He talked to me in German and asked: 'Are you Ashwaq?' I was so scared I was shaking. I said: 'No, who are you?'\"She said he then replied: \"I know you are Ashwaq, and I am Abu Humam.\"Ashwaq said he then started to talk to her in Arabic and told her not to lie to him. \"I know you, he said. And where you live and who you live with. He knew everything about my life in Germany.\"She added: \"I never in my life believed that I would see something like this in Germany. \"I left my family and my country and went to Germany to forget the beating and the pain. The last thing I expected was to meet my IS captor and that he would know everything about me.\" Germany's federal prosecutor says Ashwaq reported the incident to the police five days after she said it took place. Ashwaq says she told investigators everything, including her harrowing experiences in Iraq.Officers made an e-fit of the suspect and told her to contact the police immediately if she saw Abu Humam again.She says she also told the police to check the supermarket's CCTV, but says this did not happen. \"I waited a whole month,\" she says, but received no news. Fearful that she would see her captor again and wishing to be reunited with four of her sisters who had since been rescued from IS, Ashwaq returned to northern Iraq, leaving behind the town of Schwäbisch Gmünd where she had hoped to start a new life. \"If you haven't been through it, you won't know what it's like... it goes straight to your heart,\" she said. \"When a girl is raped by IS, you can't imagine what it's like when you see this guy again.\"Frauke Köhler, a spokeswoman for Germany's top court, says police made every effort to locate Abu Humam using the e-fit image and Ashwaq's testimony, but were unable to find him.By the time they contacted her again in June this year as part of the investigation, Ashwaq had already left for Iraq.However, activists in Germany say her case may not be an isolated incident. Düzen Tekkal, an activist and the founder of Hawar.Help, a Berlin-based organisation which campaigns for Yazidi rights, says she has heard of several cases where female Yazidi refugees recognised IS fighters in Germany.Ashwaq herself says she heard similar accounts from other Yazidi girls who had escaped the jihadists. Not all cases are reported to the authorities, however. Back in Kurdistan now living in a Yazidi camp, Ashwaq still wants to continue her education but both she and her family also want to leave the country.\"We're scared of the people of IS,\" her father told the BBC. But her experience in Germany has had a profound impact on Ashwaq.\"If the world was destroyed, I would not go to Germany again,\" she said.Like many Yazidis, her family is now applying to live in Australia as part of a special programme for women abducted by IS.",

            "content": "The US military says it is cancelling $300m (£230m) in aid to Pakistan over what it calls Islamabad's failure to take action against militant groups. President Donald Trump has previously accused Pakistan of deceiving the US while receiving billions of dollars.Pentagon spokesman Lt Col Koné Faulkner said the US military would aim to spend the money on other \"urgent priorities\".The move, which needs to be approved by the US Congress, is part of a broader suspension announced in January.The US state department has criticised Pakistan, a key ally, for failing to deal with terrorist networks operating on its soil, including the Haqqani network and the Afghan Taliban.\"We continue to press Pakistan to indiscriminately target all terrorist groups,\" Col Faulkner said in a statement on Saturday, adding that the $300m aid - which had earlier been suspended - should be used elsewhere due to \"a lack of Pakistani decisive actions\" in tackling the issue. The announcement comes just days before US Secretary of State Mike Pompeo is due to visit Pakistan to meet the country's new prime minister, Imran Khan.In January, the US government announced it was cutting almost all security aid to the country.The US and others have long complained that Pakistan provides a safe haven to militant networks, allowing them to carry out cross-border attacks in Afghanistan - something that Islamabad denies. There was no immediate comment from Pakistan on the latest funding cut. However, the military responded to January's suspension by arguing that it \"never fought for money but for peace\", and had targeted all militants at a \"heavy cost of blood and treasure\". Separately on Friday, the US said it was ending all funding for the UN's Palestinian refugee agency - the United Nations Relief and Works Agency (Unrwa) - which it described as \"irredeemably flawed\".The Haqqani network is a militant group that focuses most of its activities on neighbouring Afghanistan, which has complained for years that Pakistan allows it to operate unimpeded from its soil across the border.The group is linked to the Afghan Taliban - a hardline Islamist movement that poses a major threat to the Afghan government. Pakistani Taliban groups, while associated with the Afghan Taliban, focus on attacks within Pakistan.Both the Haqqani Network and the Afghan Taliban have launched attacks in Afghanistan that have killed US forces, and US officials have long argued that Pakistan, and specifically its ISI intelligence service, provides safe havens to them.Pakistan has long been accused of using the Afghan Taliban to further its foreign policy interests in the country. The ISI first became involved in funding and training militants in Afghanistan after the Soviet invasion in 1979.Although since 2001 Pakistan has allowed its territory to be used to supply international troops during the war in Afghanistan, and co-operated with the West in fighting some terrorists groups like al-Qaeda, analysts say it has continued to give shelter and support to Afghan insurgents.Its aim has been to limit the influence in Afghanistan of its chief regional rival, India.",

            "title": "Malcolm Turnbull: Six moments that defined Australia's ex-PM",
            "content": "His time in power was relatively brief, eventful, and like many recent Australian leaders, abruptly terminated without an election.Here are moments that loomed large in Malcolm Turnbull's three-year prime ministership, before his messy ouster by party rivals on Friday.Mr Turnbull is hardly new to internal chaos. As opposition leader in 2009, he was unseated by Tony Abbott. The latter became PM in 2013, but - and stay with us - Mr Turnbull then ousted him in 2015.In doing so, Mr Turnbull used a justification that would come back to haunt him: \"We have lost 30 Newspolls [opinion polls] in a row. It is clear that the people have made up their mind about Mr Abbott's leadership.\"Once in office, Mr Turnbull tried to differentiate himself in various ways - including by promoting more women to cabinet, and dropping an unpopular policy of conferring knights and dames.Mr Abbott had vowed \"no wrecking, no undermining, and no sniping\" of the government, but his subsequent criticisms dogged Mr Turnbull. When Mr Turnbull lost his 30th opinion poll this year, Mr Abbott publicly called on him \"to explain\". Same-sex couples could not legally wed when Mr Turnbull came to power. Although a vocal supporter of change, he drew criticism by achieving it through a national postal vote last year.Same-sex marriage advocates had warned the ballot would unleash hate campaigns - and it did become heated in many instances, with blame on both sides.Others praised the prime minister for breaking a government deadlock on the issue, paving the way for marriage equality to be signed into law last December.\"What a day for love, for equality, for respect,\" Mr Turnbull said after a vote by MPs. \"Australia has done it.\"Last year, several Australian lawmakers were ensnared in a constitutional eligibility crisis over their dual citizenship.It was no concern for Mr Turnbull until his deputy, Barnaby Joyce, was told he had New Zealand citizenship - a fact that was news to him.Mr Joyce was soon disqualified from office, imperilling Mr Turnbull's one-seat majority in the House of Representatives. Fortunately for the government, Mr Joyce was returned at a by-election - prompting a hands-aloft celebration with a relieved Mr Turnbull.Their unity was not to last, however. When Mr Joyce was later embroiled in a scandal over an affair, the pair traded personal barbs in public. Mr Joyce later stood down.Mr Turnbull's relationship with the US president got off to a famously testy start last year, with Mr Trump calling it \"the worst by far\" of all his post-election phone calls.Mr Trump had been unhappy with an Obama-era refugee deal, describing it as \"dumb\" before later telling Canberra he would uphold it.It was a rare low point in Australia's relationship with the US, its chief ally.Mr Turnbull appeared to warm to Mr Trump, however, and vocally defended him as an \"American patriot\" last month when the US president briefly contradicted his own intelligence agencies' position on Russian interference.On the global stage, Mr Turnbull's tenure was also defined by strained ties with China.Last year, he announced sweeping new laws to prevent foreign interference. In explaining why they were needed, Mr Turnbull referred to \"disturbing reports about Chinese influence\" - but insisted that was not their sole focus.Nonetheless it intensified discussion - and suspicion - that Australia's largest trading partner could be \"infiltrating\" its politics and universities.China responded by accusing Australian politicians and media of stoking \"hysteria\" and a \"Cold War mentality\".In a bid to ease tensions, Mr Turnbull gave a conciliatory speech in August in which he promised \"clearer thinking\" on China.This was the catalyst for Mr Turnbull's demise. After poor polls and by-election defeats, Mr Turnbull needed a win with his signature energy policy.Despite gaining support from a majority of government MPs, a vocal group of conservatives were unhappy with the policy and instigated a rebellion.It forced Mr Turnbull into an embarrassing U-turn on Monday, in which he scrapped plans for the policy to contain an emissions target.But it did not offset leadership rumblings. They gathered pace, and were soon seen as terminal for Mr Turnbull.",

            "title": "Ending Yemen’s never-ending war",
            "content": "\"Some people say we are in a hurry,\" says Martin Griffiths, the UN's special envoy for Yemen. \"I plead guilty to the charge.\"\"The people of Yemen have suffered quite enough. It's time.\"An air strike two weeks ago that took the lives of 44 schoolboys on a field trip, shocking even in a nation shattered by years of strife, has focused minds again on the urgent need to end a conflict that has led to the world's greatest humanitarian crisis.Mr Griffiths has now sent formal invitations to the warring parties to attend a new round of consultations in Geneva on 6 September. They will be the first talks in two years, after two failed rounds. \"The good news is, the government of Yemen wants to do this. And the Ansar Allah leadership does too,\" he says, using the official name of the rebel Houthi movement that took control of the capital Sanaa in 2014 and forced President Abdrabbuh Mansour Hadi to flee abroad the following year. Yemen's government has been backed militarily since March 2015 by a coalition of Arab states assembled by neighbouring Saudi Arabia to oust the Houthis, who are aligned to its arch-rival Iran. This punishing proxy war in the region's poorest nation has ground on, dragging Yemen to the brink of collapse. The deadly Saudi-led coalition air strike on the bus in the rebel-held northern village of Dahyan on 9 August has threatened to derail a fragile political process fraught with risk. Mr Griffiths, who took on his new role in March, is the third UN special envoy since 2011, when an Arab Spring uprising forced long-time leader Ali Abdullah Saleh to hand over power to Mr Hadi.\"There's anger and defiance,\" explains one official closely involved in the UN's new effort to find a negotiated solution to Yemen's appalling plight. \"The Houthis have been threatening not to attend because they fear the investigation into this attack will not be credible.\"Images of bloodied schoolboys, bright blue Unicef schoolbags still on their backs, sparked an international outcry and a call by the UN Security Council for a \"credible and transparent\" investigation. Fifty-five people were killed in all, and many more injured, when a bomb struck the school bus as its driver stopped to buy snacks at a bustling market. A coalition military spokesman initially said its forces attacked a \"legitimate military target\" after debris from a Houthi missile intercepted over southern Saudi Arabia killed one person and injured 11 others. Now, the coalition has said it is investigating the reports of \"collateral damage\" and will compensate victims if necessary.This latest tragedy has also reignited public criticism over the role of Western countries, including the UK and US, which are backing the coalition through billions of dollars in arms sales and operational support. The bomb deployed in the latest devastating attack which pulverised the school bus was reportedly provided by a US arms manufacturer. \"The bus attack will certainly add to pressure on Saudi Arabia and the United Arab Emirates to move toward a negotiated end to the war,\" assesses Joost Hiltermann of the International Crisis Group. \"But I'm not convinced that this will be decisive.\" Earlier this year, Mr Griffiths' sustained shuttle diplomacy and the anguished appeals of aid agencies averted an all-out assault by pro-government forces on the vital Red Sea port of Hudaydah, and the adjacent city, currently in Houthi hands. Most of the humanitarian aid on which 80% of Yemenis rely for survival comes through Hudaydah.But it also convinced the UAE, which took the lead on the Hudaydah offensive, that only a ratcheting up of military pressure would bring Houthi leaders to the negotiating table, ready to do a deal.Under greater threat, Houthi leaders had told Mr Griffiths they were prepared to hand over Hudaydah port to UN administration, a move they had resisted for years. Then the coalition shifted the goalposts. They demanded rebels withdraw from the city too. \"We think more military pressure still needs to be exerted on the Houthis,\" insists an Arab official in the coalition, underlining that victory in Hudaydah would be a game-changer that would bring a swift end to this war. But the assault against such a large city, where well-trained Houthi fighters are now entrenched, has also proven to be far more daunting than the first coalition military plans envisaged. \"The UAE and its allies have come to realise just how much it will cost them in blood and treasure, as well as in how they'll be viewed,\" comments one observer. A diplomatic source says that, in June, as the first onslaught on Hudaydah loomed, then UK Foreign Secretary Boris Johnson called UAE diplomats to urge them to give Mr Griffiths more time to come up with a negotiated solution. Mr Johnson is said to have warned of another Stalingrad - an allusion to shocking images of destruction in World War Two. Ever since the UN envoy first announced his plan to launch a new political process, all sides have expressed support for his efforts. But they have voiced pessimism too. And while the US and UK governments are known to raise concerns about coalition military tactics in private with Saudi Arabia and the UAE, in public they defend their long-standing allies.\"There's a strong impression that they support the man, but not the plan,\" is how a Western Yemen expert puts their approach to Mr Griffith's mission. \"That's them having their cake and eating it too,\" he explained. \"They say: 'We totally want Martin to create peace, but if his plan upsets our partners, we're not going to push.'\"Iran's role is also a factor. But the extent of its military support, and its sway over the Houthis, is disputed.\"The Iranians play a role in allowing the Houthis to believe they can hold out,\" says Mr Hiltermann. \"But the Houthis have shown in the past that the Iranians don't have that much influence over them.\" The bar has deliberately been set low for this next round of talks in Geneva. But some observers see rare glimmers of hope. \"There's fatigue,\" points out one analyst following the process closely. \"Yemenis are exhausted by this conflict.\" And the arrival of the experienced, plain-speaking UN mediator has translated into enhanced access in all capitals, including meetings with senior Houthi leaders. \"The Houthis are now willing, and not afraid, to make concessions they weren't a year ago including on Hudaydah,\" a Yemen expert added. Sources say the rebel leaders have made new offers, including a proposal to freeze the fighting, as well as alternative arrangements for Hudaydah city. Geneva will only be talks about talks, an informal discussion only among Yemenis. The ambition is to move gradually towards more substantive negotiations in a broad process that draws on dialogue in backchannels, shuttling between capitals, and engagement with Yemenis across civil society. Mr Griffiths describes the goal as a \"transitional political operation under a national unity government... and security arrangements for the withdrawal of all armed groups.\"\"Baby steps, just baby steps,\" is the phrase used by Bashraheel Hisham Bashraheel, deputy editor-in-chief of Al-Ayam newspaper in the southern Yemeni city of Aden, which is under government control. Like baby steps, there's a great risk this new process will falter - just like the last two rounds. \"Geneva will be a beginning,\" says Mr Griffiths. \"Even a beginning is good.\" ",

            "title": "South Africa: The groups playing on the fears of a 'white genocide’",
            "content": "Taking a swipe at UK Prime Minister Theresa May as she struggled to dance with schoolchildren during her visit to South Africa this week, controversial British columnist Katie Hopkins tweeted: \"Whites are being slaughtered in South Africa & inexplicably Appeaser May chooses to crucify herself\".Hopkins' tweet was the latest example of a global campaign to portray South Africa's once dominant white population as a victimised minority under attack. \"The violent, ethnic cleansing of white farmers by armed, black gangs is infuriating & heartbreaking. And the world doesn't care. Or at least the mainstream media doesn't care. Do you?\" she added. Her comments reflect the growing influence of South Africa's conservative Afrikaner groups who are conducting global lobbying campaigns to support their message that white farmers are being targeted and killed, that the government is seizing their land, they are being discriminated against by affirmative action programmes and that their language is being sidelined.US President Donald Trump has also taken up the cudgels on their behalf, tweeting last week that he had asked Secretary of State Mike Pompeo to closely study \"land and farm seizures and expropriations and the large scale killing of farmers\" in South Africa. Between April 2016 and March 2017, 74 people - of all races - were murdered on farms in South Africa, according to police figures, compared to more than 19,000 murders nationwide in the same period.The BBC has found that there is no reliable data to suggest farmers are at greater risk of being murdered than the average South African.On the land question, the government has not yet started seizing farms but says it will change the constitution to allow it to expropriate land without compensation, hence the intense lobbying by those linked to farmers.The government says this is needed to reverse the forced eviction of black farmers under white minority rule.Mr Trump's intervention was a political coup for AfriForum - the main South African lobby group championing the cause of Afrikaners, especially farmers. \"They [Afriforum] are gripped in a siege mentality. They can't see a world where their privilege is challenged. They disregard history,\" said University of South Africa political analyst Somadoda Fikeni. More than 24 years after the end of apartheid, white people enjoy average standards of living far higher than black South Africans.But Mr Fikeni accepts that it is unlikely that groups like AfriForum will give in easily. \"Afrikaner nationalism was built around farming and language, so they see this as an existential crisis,\" he said.AfriForum's leaders, Kallie Kriel and Ernest Roets, toured the US earlier this year, meeting conservative think-tanks, the government's international aid agency USAid, and Mr Trump's security adviser John Bolton, who was given a book which alleges that the South African government is complicit in the killing of white farmers, or boers.  But the main influence on Mr Trump's tweet was Fox News' Tucker Carlson, who aired a programme about farm killings, and who had also hosted Mr Roets during AfriForum's US tour.  Mr Roets welcomed the tweet - despite the fact that it incorrectly claimed the South African government was \"now seizing land\".\"I think our lobbying has certainly had an impact because we have spoken with a lot of people who have had contact with President Trump and we have spoken with many think tanks, one of them, for example, the Cato Institute, which has taken a very strong stance shortly before this statement by President Trump.\"Mr Kriel told the BBC that he did not believe the \"wording\" of the tweet should be debated, and the focus should instead be on protecting property rights rather than allowing the South African government to press ahead with its plans. \"A crisis can be averted if there is international pressure. If you turn a blind eye, it can bring us to the position of Zimbabwe. We don't want the country to be destroyed,\" he said. The chaotic and sometimes violent seizure of white-owned land in neighbouring Zimbabwe, which had a similar history of European settlement, has been widely blamed for wrecking the country's once prosperous economy.AfriForum is not the only Afrikaner group which has lobbied in the US. Another one is the far smaller and more extreme Suidlanders (Afrikaans for Southlanders), whose members Simon Roche and André Coetzee carried out a six-month visit to the US last year. They met various far-right activists, including David Duke, the former Grand Wizard of the Ku Klux Klan and Trump supporter, as well as other white supremacists and Nazi sympathisers, according to South African journalist Lloyd Gedye.\"This network has allowed the Suidlanders to spread its message of 'white genocide' around the world,\" he wrote in the Mail & Guardian newspaper.This includes Australia, where several right-wing rallies have been held this year with protesters - many of them white South African migrants - holding up placards such as \"Recognise the genocide\" and \"Stop the murders\". The message has resonated with Australia's former Home Affairs Minister Peter Dutton who said in March that he was looking at giving South Africa's white farmers access to fast-track visas because they were being \"persecuted\" and needed help from a \"civilised\" country.This prompted outrage from the South African government.Mr Fikeni told the BBC that international support for South Africa's white farmers was not surprising, and tied in with the votes for Brexit and Donald Trump, and the rise of right-wing parties across Europe. \"The anti-establishment is growing across the world, partly because of immigration pressures. There are those who feel local cultures are being invaded, who want whiteness to be maintained in its purest form,\" the political analyst said. The view that white South Africans are at risk of a \"genocide\" has also been taken up by members of the Europe of Nations and Freedom Group, a small right-wing group in the European parliament. British national Janice Atkinson - who serves in the parliament as an independent after being expelled by the pro-Brexit UK Independence Party (UKIP) - unsuccessfully pushed for a parliamentary debate on South African farm murders last November. In February, Ms Atkinson - who has built strong relations with South Africa's right-wing Freedom Front Plus - wrote to then-UK Foreign Secretary Boris Johnson, urging him to push the South African government to drop its land reform plans. Trump's tweet and the factsIs South Africa's land reform an election gimmick?South Africans' anger over land set to explodeShe added that South Africa \"is on the brink of another Zimbabwe\" and quoted Freedom Front Plus leader Connie Mulder, as saying that South Africa \"could slip into a Rwandan situation\". Some 800,000 people were killed in the 1994 genocide in the East African country. \"The world must open its eyes now to what is happening. If it does not it will have blood on its hands for not acting to prevent what will, tragically, be an entirely predictable catastrophe,\" she wrote.Mr Kriel said AfriForum believed that as South Africa was its former colony, the UK had an \"extra responsibility\" to put pressure on the African National Congress (ANC) government not to expropriate land without compensation. But Mrs May, during her visit to South Africa, said she supported measures that were legal and transparent and she welcomed President Cyril Ramaphosa's assurances there would be \"no smash and grab\" seizures of land.The editor of the UK-based Africa Confidential publication, Patrick Smith, said he believed that Mrs May's comments were \"recommended by the Foreign and Commonwealth Office to differentiate the UK's position from that of Trump and his white nationalist pals\". Since the vote to leave the European Union, the UK government was \"working hard to get a foothold in markets it hasn't paid attention to\" so it was unlikely to strain relations with the South African government over land, Mr Smith added. Unlike other groups, AfriForum was not claiming that there was a genocide against white South Africans, but there were \"elements\" of it, like inflammatory rhetoric and the brutal murder of farmers, Mr Kriel said. In 2011, the High Court banned the song Shoot the Boer - then the political signature tune of radical Economic Freedom Front (EFF) leader Julius Malema - saying it amounted to hate speech. \"The words of one person inciting others... that's how a genocide can start,\" said Judge Collin Lamont as he delivered his judgement on Mr Malema, whose vocal, and popular, calls for land reform have pushed the ANC to toughen its position.Mr Kriel said AfriForum believed that the ANC's land reform plan had reneged on the pact reached with Afrikaners when apartheid ended in 1994.  \"There is supposed to be a just system where there is no infringement of human rights and property rights,\" he said.But for Mr Fikeni, AfriForum is selectively reading the constitution, which outlines the rights of all South Africans. \"There needs to be redistribution to address the wrongs of the past. You can't talk about reconciliation and forget social justice,\" he said. ",

            "title": "Russia pension protests: Fresh anti-reform rallies held",
            "content": "Further protests against pension reforms have taken place in Russia, despite the recent concessions offered by President Vladimir Putin. Independent observers say more than 10,000 people took part in rallies in Moscow. Other cities also saw demonstrations.The initial proposal was to raise the retirement age for women to 63 from 55, and for men to 65 from 60.On Wednesday he said the pension age for women would only be raised to 60. Mr Putin has said reform is a financial necessity, but it has been met with a hostile reception and led to a steep fall in his popularity. Unions have warned that many will not live long enough to claim a pension. Russian men have a life expectancy of 66 while for women it is 77, the World Health Organization says.Under the new plan, to be implemented from 2019, the retirement age for men will be increased gradually from 60 to 65.Before Mr Putin's intervention women were to have to work another eight years from 55 to 63 - their planned retirement age has now been reduced to 60.Women with three or more children could retire earlier, Mr Putin said.Prime Minister Dmitry Medvedev has previously said the decision was motivated by the fact that Russians are living longer and leading more active lives.He said there were 12 million working pensioners in Russia, equal to nearly a quarter of all pensioners.In a TV address last week, Mr Putin said the move to raise the retirement age for men and women had been delayed for years and risked causing inflation and increasing poverty.Postponing it further would threaten the stability and security of Russian society, he said.\"Any further delay would be irresponsible,\" he said. \"Our decisions should be just and well-balanced.\"Until his TV address he had attempted to distance himself from the row, and had in the past promised that the pension age would never be raised on his watch.Tens of thousands have rallied across Russia in recent weeks.Sunday's Moscow protest saw many carrying the red flags and banners of the Communist Party, the principal organiser of the protest.A smaller protest was held by the centre-left Just Russia party, which police said attracted some 1,500 people.Unusually for Russia, protesters against the reforms come from all sides of the political debate.The initial announcement was made at the same time as the World Cup in Russia began, prompting criticism that the Russian government was trying to bury bad news.Most economists and many Russians agree there is a problem. The population is getting older and the state is spending more and more on pensions.After the economic chaos of the early 1990s, Russia's population plummeted. The birth rate has since shown some signs of improvement, but it is not happening fast enough.Based on current trends, 20% of Russians will be over 65 by 2050, says the UN.President Putin has just signed a new bill on pension spending, envisaging a deficit of more than 265bn roubles (£3.1bn; $4.2bn) in 2018. That's 1.6% of the entire state budget expenditure.It is clearly not a sustainable situation, especially in tough economic times.",

            "title": "Letter from Africa: Should Ghanaian women be limited to three babies?",
            "content": "In our series of letters from African journalists, Elizabeth Ohene considers the controversial proposal to limit women to having three babies in Ghana.Among the Ga, the people who are indigenous to Ghana's capital, Accra, a woman is entitled to a live sheep on the delivery of her 10th child. The word for it is \"nyongmato\". I am not making this up even though it does sound like the kind of apocryphal story that is regularly made up. Lots of very important people among the Gas can testify to this. Unfortunately, I have not met any woman who has actually got a live sheep for having given birth to 10 children. Indeed, I have never met any woman who has had 10 children. I don't know if I have been moving in the wrong circles, because I don't even know any woman who has had five children. OK, as soon as I wrote that, I realised I was wrong. Two months ago, I went to the funeral of a female relation of mine who was my classmate in primary school. At her death, this relation of mine had 46 direct descendants; made up of eight children, 26 grandchildren and counting, and 10 great-grandchildren and counting. I was scandalised and I spent the entire funeral going over these figures and moaning to myself how easy it was to find the reasons for the poverty in Ghana. I have been waging a lonely unpopular battle about the rate of population growth in our country and against women having so many babies, but to no avail. I roll out what I consider to be a sound argument that I thought would win over all doubters. I cite Norway, which had a population of 3.5 million to Ghana's five million at the time of our independence in 1957.Today, there are 5.3 million people living in Norway while Ghana has a population of nearly 30 million.I make the argument that even if none of our rulers ever stole any public funds, we would still have economic difficulties at this rate of population growth. The last time I visited Lillehammer in Norway, I wrote in my column about the difference in our two situations. I pointed out it is no wonder everything is bursting at the seams and we are forever worrying about the lack of classrooms. Somehow, these arguments don't cut any ice with people here because it is considered in extremely bad taste to complain about the number of children somebody has. As someone once claimed to me: \"In our tradition we don't count children.\"  Elizabeth Ohene:\"Dr Appiah is an exceptionally brave woman. She has proposed that women should be restricted to having three children\"The good news is that now I don't feel alone in this battle. Into the fray has jumped the Executive Director of the National Population Council, Dr Leticia Adelaide Appiah, and believe me, she is an exceptionally brave woman. She is not speaking in parables, she is straight to the point. She has proposed that women should be restricted to having three children. And she says this should be obligatory. If a woman goes beyond this sacred number of three, she would be punished by being denied access to free government services.We have to talk about the quality of life, Dr Appiah has been arguing. I don't recall that anyone in an official position has been this categorical in Ghana about family planning ever before. We have had a family planning policy since 1970 but usually people only talk about the spacing of births and then hope that the spacing will lead to the birth of fewer children. This time around Dr Appiah is urging a cap on the number of children a woman should have.  It is interesting to note that that the people who claim to be outraged by the proposal to limit the number of children have been largely men. I'm sorry none of their arguments stick in my mind long enough to repeat here. I have not yet heard any woman complain that they don't want the number of children they can have to be restricted. Ghana's fertility rate, that is the average number of children per woman, currently stands at four, though that figure has fallen steadily over the last 30 years.Another interesting statistic worth noting is that there has not been a single death from measles in Ghana since 2002. Measles used to be one of the main infant killers, and the main justification for having many births. This past week, I have been doing a very unscientific survey. Every pregnant woman I have seen, I have asked which number it was and I have not yet met a woman in her third pregnancy. But I am probably looking in the wrong place by asking working women in banks, in offices and shops; the high birth rates can be found mostly in the rural areas. There might yet be some women who are aspiring to get that live sheep. We would probably have to find an equally attractive present for every woman who decides to stop at three or below. The problem is I can't think what can possibly challenge the \"10-baby sheep\", nyongmato.

            "title": "Pope Francis faces twin battle in Church split over sexual abuse",
            "content": "The crowds are quieter than they used to be. At the Pope's weekly audience in St Peter's Square, tourists and pilgrims barely filled half the piazza. It was easy to get to the front of the crowd to watch Francis go by in his Popemobile. In his address, he reflected on his recent trip to Ireland. \"The meeting with eight survivors [of abuse by priests] left a deep impact,\" he said.  The audience was a sombre reminder that the novelty of this papacy has given way to two main battles, which are now tangled into one. The first of these battles puts the Pope up against those who accuse him of not doing enough to tackle child abuse in the Church. Francis's opponents are an ad hoc coalition of abuse survivors, angry Catholics, and secular leaders who believe that the Church has too much unchecked power. The second battle sees the Pope fighting conservative Catholic critics who accuse him of diluting their faith. These critics began their fight shortly after Francis was elected in 2013. In particular, they object to his moves to allow divorced and remarried Catholics to take Communion. They are now adopting the subject of the first battle - child abuse - as a new front in their own long offensive. The two battles come together in the 11-page statement released by Archbishop Carlo Maria Vigano on 26 August.In the statement, the archbishop accused the Pope of failing to act in 2013 on allegations that Cardinal Theodore McCarrick had abused minors. The Pope's supporters vehemently question the credibility of this accusation. The archbishop's letter also made broader, conservative attacks on the way the Church is run.  \"The homosexual networks present in the Church must be eradicated,\" Archbishop Vigano wrote. \"These homosexual networks… act under the concealment of secrecy and lie with the power of octopus tentacles, and strangle innocent victims and priestly vocations, and are strangling the entire Church.\" To some Vatican-watchers, these accusations sound familiar. \"At the heart of it all is this animus against the Pope,\" says Robert Mickens, English-language editor of La Croix International.\"Vigano is kind of a strange character in this case because it's really a whole group of people. What is the motive behind this? To bring down Pope Francis in any way possible. They're trying to catch him in a trap. And Francis is not falling for it.\" But another group of conservative journalists in Rome gives voice to much of the dissatisfaction with Pope Francis. Edward Pentin, from the National Catholic Register, published the Vigano statement. He denies being part of an orchestrated campaign to bring down the Pope. \"I don't think there's any such organised campaign, but there has long been a growing and deep sense of concern and even anger about this pontificate among many practising Catholics,\" he says.\"They are particularly frustrated because they are trying to uphold the Church's teaching and morals but are not feeling well served by the Pope and much of the hierarchy.\"They sense this especially now, with questionable innovative teachings coming from the Vatican and reports of abuse cover up at the highest levels. I believe these Catholics' voices should be heard, and, as a Catholic journalist, I see it as my job to try to make sure they are.\" Those voices include a number of cardinals. In 2016, four of them wrote to Francis calling on him to clarify his teaching. It was seen as a highly unusual act of protest or even disobedience. Their letter, openly questioning the Pope's judgement, foreshadowed the statement released by Archbishop Vigano. Francis did not reply to the cardinals' letter. Nor has he replied to Carlo Maria Vigano's accusations.The Pope has clearly decided that there is nothing to be gained by engaging in open battle with conservative critics.  \"He is no pushover,\" says Robert Mickens. \"He is standing his ground.\"Popes can expect to find themselves taking on dissident factions within the Church. In 1988, Pope John Paul II took the dramatic step of excommunicating some members of a renegade religious society led by the French Archbishop Marcel Lefebvre which had rejected Vatican reforms. Benedict XVI took a strict line against priests who strayed from official teaching.  The fight against doctrinal opponents may be the easier of Francis's two battles. The Pope's wider public fight to convince the other critics inside and outside the Church that he is capable of confronting the institution's legacy of clerical sexual abuse may be much more difficult.

            "title": "Bobi Wine: Uganda's pop star MP arrives in US for treatment",
            "content": "Ugandan pop star and MP Bobi Wine has arrived in the US for medical treatment following accusations he was tortured and beaten while in military custody.The former rapper was initially prevented from leaving the country but was cleared to fly out on Friday.He, and 32 opposition politicians, were charged with treason last week over the alleged stoning of President Yoweri Museveni's convoy.Bobi Wine was later granted bail. The army denies allegations of torture. On Friday, police confirmed that Bobi Wine had been cleared to fly out of the country for specialised treatment after the government sent a team of nine doctors to examine him.His lawyer, Robert Amsterdam, said the pop star had also been violently re-arrested at the airport on Thursday \"even though the judge had let him have his passport because he needed to leave the country for medical reasons\". A police spokesman had confirmed on Twitter that Bobi Wine was being given a medical examination because of the allegations of torture.Police said that another opposition MP, Francis Zaake, who was also trying to go abroad for treatment, had been \"trying to flee the country and accordingly apprehended him\".On Friday, supporters of Bobi Wine held protests in the capital, Kampala. Pictures shared on social media showed plumes of smoke rising in the streets, with local media reporting that the protests were confined to Kamwokya slum, where the MP grew up. Security deploys in Kamwokya slum where residents were earlier protesting the re-arrest of Hon. Kyagulanyi also known as Bobi Wine \"The Ghetto President\". Bobi wine was last night blocked from traveling abroad for further treatment. #NTVNews https://t.co/3MaCh0unQp pic.twitter.com/hT67Qc1plOEnd of Twitter post  by @ntvugandaOn Monday Bobi Wine, whose real name is Robert Kyagulanyi, appeared on crutches during a court appearance. His allies say he was tortured by elite presidential guards during his detention. The army have described the allegations as \"rubbish\".His aides say he was later re-arrested at Uganda's main international airport where he was planning to board a plane to Washington for further medical treatment.\"He's in tremendous pain and suffered very serious injuries,\" Mr Amsterdam had said of the star's condition. \"There's not a part of his body that isn't in pain.\"\"His children were going to stay in Uganda. It was a brief trip, simply for a medical evaluation,\" he added.Before being arrested, Bobi Wine tweeted a gruesome picture of his driver, who he said had been shot dead by police thinking he was the MP. Bobi Wine was arrested on 13 August after a campaign rally in the north-western town of Arua where the presidential convoy was allegedly stoned.The 36-year-old musician was initially to be tried in a military court over accusations of unlawful possession of firearms but the charge was dropped. A civilian court later charged him with treason.Bobi Wine, and the other accused, were expected to appear in court again on Thursday but the hearing has been adjourned to 1 October.The Afrobeats star has been a thorn in the side of Mr Museveni's government. Since his election as an MP just over a year ago, he has backed candidates in three by-elections who have beaten those from the ruling National Resistance Movement (NRM), including in Arua.He was also a leading campaigner against the move to scrap the presidential age limit - set at 75 - which would have locked out the 74-year-old Mr Museveni's bid to run for a sixth term in 2021.Wine also joined local activists in July to protest against a social media tax introduced ostensibly to boost state revenue and to end what Mr Museveni called \"gossip\" on WhatsApp, Facebook and Twitter.Critics, however, said the 200 Uganda shillings ($0.05, £0.04) daily tax was meant to suppress dissenting voices.The government has since said it will review the tax.",

            "title": "Why McCain picked these 15 pallbearers",
            "content": "One of the bittersweet benefits of knowing one's life is coming to an end is the ability to make plans for how one will be memorialised. Senator John McCain reportedly took to the task with his trademark gusto, holding weekly meetings to arrange the details of his funeral and accompanying events.\"By the time he died on Saturday, Mr McCain had carefully stage-managed a four-day celebration of his life - but what was also an unmistakable rebuke to President Trump and his agenda,\" write Mike Shear and Katie Rogers in the New York Times. This included reaching out to those McCain wanted as pallbearers - a process he started in April. A total of 14 men and one woman will accompany the late senator's coffin into the National Cathedral in Washington DC on Saturday. The officially released list - which identifies them all as \"friends\" before offering further details - is fraught with meaning. Why on earth did McCain pick Warren Beatty, long a fixture among the liberal Hollywood elite, for this place of honour? It turns out the two had a friendship dating back to the 1990s. While they differed on many political subjects, the Oscar-winning Hollywood actor and the Arizona senator viewed campaign finance reform that would limit the corrupting influence of money on politics as a top policy priority. \"I've known John McCain for a long time,\" Beatty said in a 2008 interview with the Atlantic. \"He is a conservative.\"I think I've made it clear that I'm a liberal Democrat,\" Beatty continued. \"I don't think that political ideology is necessarily germane to friendships.\"It's been billed as McCain's \"final dig\" at Russian President Vladimir Putin - and Donald Trump. By selecting Russian opposition politician Vladimir Kara-Murza, McCain re-emphasised his repeated criticisms of the Putin regime and what he viewed as Mr Trump's too-cosy attitude toward it.McCain and Kara-Murza's friendship dates back to 2010 and the Arizona senator's support of Russian pro-democracy demonstrations. The two would later co-operate in marshalling support in Congress for Russian sanctions measures.Kara-Murza has twice been the target of apparent poison-based assassination attempts, the most recent, in February 2017, left him in a coma.\"Much has and will be written about McCain's military courage, his patriotism, his famed bipartisanship and his unimpeachable personal decency,\" Kara-Murza writes in a Washington Post tribute to the senator. \"His long-standing position on Russia deserves a special tribute.\"Two ex-presidents, Democrat Barack Obama and Republican George W Bush, will deliver eulogies for McCain, and the cast of officeholders among his pallbearers reinforces the bipartisan theme.Vice-President Joe Biden, a former Senate colleague, will also give a eulogy for McCain at services in Phoenix. Another Democrat, former Senator Russ Feingold, co-sponsored McCain's signature legislative achievement, the Bipartisan Campaign Reform Act of 2002 - which the two passed over the determined opposition of the chamber's Republican leadership.There are also several politicians who blurred traditional party lines - Republican-turned-independent former New York City Mayor Michael Bloomberg and William Cohen, a Republican senator who served in as secretary of defence in the Clinton administration.Like McCain, former Senator Gary Hart of Colorado once ran his own nearly successful insurgent presidential primary campaign, against Democrat Walter Mondale in 1984. Senator Sheldon Whitehouse of Rhode Island (the only current office-holder), former Texas Senator Phil Gramm and former Secretary of Homeland Security Tom Ridge round out the group. As with many politicians - at least, the good ones - McCain had a retinue of loyal aides and staffers who stuck with him for years. Mark Salter, McCain's former senate chief of staff, was also his top speechwriter and muse, co-writing seven books, including the 1999 best-seller about his family's military legacy and his time as a prisoner of war, Faith of My Fathers.Rick Davis, who took centre stage earlier this week when he read McCain's final words to the nation, served as the senator's campaign manager for both his 2000 and 2008 presidential bids.   As McCain knew as well as any public official, money is the fuel that powers a career in politics. He made campaign finance reform one of his life-long efforts, and perhaps his most prominent legislative achievements. Lofty principles, however, don't pay the campaign bills. Among the lesser-known pallbearers on Saturday are the people McCain relied on to bankroll his political ambitions.Fred Smith, founder of global delivery company Federal Express, served as national co-chair of McCain's 2008 presidential bid. Carla Eudy, a family friend and the only woman among the pallbearers, was McCain's 2008 national finance director and headed a McCain-affiliated political action committee. Rounding out the list is California communications executive Stephen Dart, a long-time Republican donor who also served as a fund-raiser for McCain's 2008 campaign.",

            "title": "Uganda's Bobi Wine crisis: The president and the pop star",
            "content": "Uganda's President Yoweri Museveni seems to be worried about the popularity of musician-turned-politician Bobi Wine.Not long after I arrive at the recording studio of the Afrobeats star, a pick-up truck with soldiers pulls up. Bobi Wine was charged this week with treason - and tension is high in Kamwokya, a slum where he grew up in the capital, Kampala.But is the 36-year-old, affectionately known as the \"ghetto president\", really a threat to Mr Museveni's three-decade rule?The show of force indicates the authorities are taking no chances.The officers file past a wall mural of Bobi Wine as they march into Kamwokya, past a small shop belonging to 26-year-old Idd Kibirige.He sells everything from music downloads, DVDs, phone chargers and power banks, things any self-respecting millennial would not be without. Outside speakers blare out Bobi Wine's biggest hits.\"We're playing him because he is in prison,\" Mr Kibirige says.Bobi Wine, whose real name is Robert Kyagulani, started his music career here more than 15 years ago. When he recently turned to politics, he won a seat in parliament by a landslide in a June 2017 by-election.Since then he has gone on to campaign for several parliamentary candidates who won seats from President Museveni's National Resistance Movement (NRM).The tension in Kampala stems from a bitterly fought by-election in the north-western town of Arua earlier this month which saw Bobi Wine and the president campaign for rival candidates.Bobi Wine's driver was found shot dead in a car. The police allege he was hit by a stray bullet as officers fought opposition crowds who were throwing stones at Mr Museveni's motorcade. The facts are still disputed but the pop star is now charged with treason, alongside 32 others. The political Afrobeats starSoldiers are accused of torturing him whilst in detention - a charge the authorities deny. When he appeared in court, he was unable to walk or stand by himself. Treason attracts the death penalty, although Uganda has not executed anyone since 2005. And they may not be convicted - veteran opposition leader Kizza Besigye has faced a treason charge and been freed, and is currently on bail following another charge of treason in 2016.For many in Kamwokya, Bobi Wine's whirlwind political career, as well as his socially conscious music, are inspiring.\"We want him because now he is our voice,\" says Mr Kibirige, who started his business after failing to find a job despite having a degree.\"[We want] Bobi Wine to be the next president.\" Uganda's politics today is not just about power but demographics and access to opportunities. More than three-quarters of Uganda's 35.6 million people are below the age of 30.Although data varies, youth unemployment is high. Some like the charity Action Aid puts it at 62% while the African Development Bank says it is 83%.These people are Bobi Wine's support base.President Museveni, 74, has not been watching from the sidelines. Despite championing a social media tax, he has used Facebook to reach out to young Ugandans and address their anger over Bobi Wine's detention.In the process, he has angered some by referring to young people as \"bazukulu\", meaning grandchildren - further highlighting the gap in age and possibly perception of much of the electorate.In one of his latest lengthy posts, the president defended his record on job creation, and criticised those who \"cynically\" lured the youth to protest.\"Our unemployed youth are a problem but a good one given that we have already laid the basis for resolving unemployment,\" he wrote.But Fred Muhumuza, an economist who used to work at Uganda's finance ministry, believes Mr Museveni is running out of time.You cannot make a promise to 20-year-old and the make him wait 10 years, he says.\"At 30 if he has not seen the promise come true, he becomes jittery. [Young people] become nervous for all the right reasons,\" he adds.The weakness of Uganda's opposition parties has also helped Bobi Wine's rise.They have often been criticised for not working together and lacking strong ideas on how to govern.In recent months the biggest of these, the Forum for Democratic Change (FDC), has been wracked by bitter and public infighting.And some political commentators say Bobi Wine's emergence could spell the beginning of the end for Mr Besigye, who has been Uganda's most high-profile opposition figure for many years.He has been the FDC's candidate against Mr Museveni in the last four elections - and some feel he needs to make way for others to challenge the 74-year-old president.More on Uganda:But Mr Besigye says to suggest that he feels threatened by Bobi Wine just creates divisions.\"[It's not about] Besigye and Museveni, Bobi Wine and Museveni or even Bobi Wine and Besigye,\" he told the BBC.\"This is the contestation of the people of Uganda for their liberation.\"Mr Besigye, who has suffered harassment, arrests and months in detention over many years, has some advice for Bobi Wine.\"It has to be understood that a struggle has a cost. Every struggle has a cost and every liberation has a cost and that cost must be borne by some people. And I don't regret doing my small bit.\"Despite the events of the last week, some in the ruling party are dismissive of Bobi Wine.\"If you want to gauge his support politically, let him stand for president. Otherwise the fact that people may sympathise does not mean they support you,\" says Moses Byaruhanga, the senior presidential adviser on political affairs.And despite the hopes of Mr Kibirige and Bobi Wine's other supporters, the pop star has not declared any ambitions to run for president.Ugandans will give you a list of other young charismatic opposition leaders whose political rise has been cut short, so there is no guarantee that Bobi Wine will survive this hurdle.Nevertheless, his emergence as a potent political figure has highlighted how the next election in 2021 is likely to be fought and won - winning the hearts and minds of young, frustrated Ugandans.",

            "content": "On an overcast afternoon, small candles flicker on the paving stones where, in the early hours of Sunday morning, a German carpenter in his thirties was fatally stabbed in a street fight. Even now, complete strangers arrive to lay flowers, stand in silence, hold hands. This growing makeshift memorial has become a focus for this troubled city's grief and anger.Little is known about how or why the brawl started. Police have dismissed rumours circulating online that the man was defending a woman from sexual assault. But within hours of his death in hospital, news that his killers were suspected to have been a Syrian and an Iraqi man triggered a furious and violent reaction.For two nights running, hundreds and then thousands of right-wing extremists and sympathisers have taken to the streets.The police openly admit they have been caught on the back foot both by the number of protesters and the speed at which they have mobilised. The groups behind the demonstrations have used social media to bring people together quickly. On Monday night in particular, organisers were able to galvanise supporters from all over the country. The seemingly spontaneous outbreak of violent xenophobia has shocked many in Germany.Pictures of demonstrators openly using the Nazi salute - a criminal offence in Germany - chasing and attacking people of foreign appearance and flinging bottles and fireworks have horrified many Germans, for whom the legacy of World War Two is a lasting belief that this country bears a special responsibility to fight any form of fascism.But many are not surprised. Right-wing sentiment and extremism have tended to find more fertile ground in Germany's former east - fuelled, some argue, by the social and economic inequality that followed reunification.  Associated violence was much higher last year for example in this part of the country than the west. The head of Saxony's intelligence services, Gordian Meyer-Plath, has said there is an organised scene in Chemnitz that includes right-wing hooligan structures such as the \"NS boys\" or \"Kaotik Chemnitz\" - organised around their support for the local football club. Both groups took part in the weekend's demonstrations.  The intelligence services reckon there were just over 23,000 right-wing extremists in Germany in 2016. German authorities have now vowed to intensify their efforts in the fight against them.But people who would describe themselves as ordinary citizens joined the demonstrations in Chemnitz, too. Since 2015, when hundreds of thousands of people sought asylum in Germany, anti-migrant sentiment has manifested much more strongly in the old east. Anti-migrant grassroots movement Pegida harnessed public concern in Saxony with weekly marches in Dresden, which at their height attracted 20,000 people.Some were extremists. But all marched together, chanting the old Nazi slogan \"Lügenpresse\" (lying press).Pegida also encouraged demonstrations in Chemnitz at the weekend, but it is no longer the force it was. Hard on its heels came the far-right Alternative for Germany (AfD) party. Saxony may have encountered relatively few asylum seekers. But it is a stronghold for the anti-migrant party which national polls suggest is also on its way to becoming the country's second largest party. The pictures from Chemnitz - the rage, the sorrow, the violence - suggest a Germany aflame with resistance to migration. There is much evidence to the contrary.The number of people seeking asylum has fallen steeply and there are integration success stories - one in four new arrivals has a job.A national poll recently found that Germans are now more concerned about health, pensions and climate policy. But migration remains a highly charged political theme. And, even as local politicians appeal for calm, Germany's establishment has yet to find a way to truly soothe the disquiet which roared into such violence at the weekend. ",

            "title": "Viewpoint: Ortega's Nicaragua crisis evokes memories of past",
            "content": "Javier Bauluz is a Pulitzer Prize-winning Spanish photojournalist who has been reporting on the recent wave of protests in Nicaragua in which hundreds of people have been killed. He argues that there are parallels between the current crisis and Nicaragua's armed conflict of the 1980s, which he also covered.\"How did we not realise that they were becoming monsters? How did we let them get away with so much?\" an old woman asked me, crying, at an anti-government demonstration in the Nicaraguan capital, Managua, at the end of April.The upset woman was a former member of the Sandinista rebel group, which successfully rose up against President Anastasio Somoza in 1979, thereby putting an end to more than 40 years of bloody rule by his family. Now, four decades on from the overthrow of Somoza, she was taking to the streets against the government of Daniel Ortega, himself a former rebel and Sandinista leader.After winning four presidential elections, Mr Ortega has been in power for more than 16 of the 39 years since Somoza was ousted.When the crying old woman said she regretted \"letting them get away with\", she was talking about the repression she saw coming from Mr Ortega's administration after the anti-government protests began on 18 April. When I landed in Managua on the fifth day of protests, the number of people killed stood at 27, according to figures from the Nicaraguan Association for Human Rights (ANPDH). According to that same organisation, that number had gone up to 448 by 26 July. A veteran of the fight against Somoza, Mr Ortega has failed to realise that there are new arms available to those fighting today's battles.The internet and social media have become both tools and weapons for those demonstrating against President Ortega.They are using them to organise protests and to document human rights violations carried out by his government.I think that Mr Ortega's thinking is stuck in the 1980s. He does not realise that having control of a large part of the traditional media, mostly owned by his sons, is no longer enough to control the flow of information. But there are things that remind me of what I experienced in Nicaragua of the 1980s: the strength, courage and determination, which I have seen among the young and those not so young (among those taking to the streets are also mothers, fathers and grandparents).These days, medical students are detained for treating peaceful protesters who do not have anywhere else to turn after being banned from seeking help in hospitals.These doctors and aspiring doctors have to act clandestinely. That reminds me of 1986 and 1987 when medical and other students in Managua would volunteer to harvest coffee in the north of the country.At that time, Daniel Ortega was in his first term in office and was fighting against the anti-Sandinista rebels, who emerged after Somoza was ousted. Coffee was practically Nicaragua's only source of income during the war against the Contra rebels. The Contras, on the other hand, enjoyed the backing of the US government to the tune of $100m, after President Ronald Reagan had labelled the Sandinista government a \"Communist regime\" and a \"terrorist\" state.The young peaceful protesters of today remind me of those students whom I met in the coffee plantations, carrying AK-47 rifles in one hand and baskets full of coffee beans in the other.The rifles were essential as the area came under constant attack by the Contras. One medical student, who went by the name of Nadia, always got up early in the mornings to lead the group to where they would harvest that day.With her rifle slung across her shoulder she would go first, knowingly running the risk of treading on one of the many mines that littered the countryside.  That courage and determination which I witnessed in the 1980s and that clever Nicaraguan sense of humour and joy of life which I admire so much, I have come across again at today's barricades - even when the bullets were flying over our heads.They have conquered fear, just like those students did in the 80s.The phrase that I have heard over and over again here in Nicaragua is: \"They're going, one way or another\".It refers to President Ortega and his wife Rosario Murillo, who is also the country's vice-president, and the protesters' aim to kick them out of office, if not the country.What remains to be seen is how long the couple will take to leave and how much more blood has to be shed before they do. President Ortega blames everything on the protesters and denies any responsibility. He has even gone as far as flatly denying the existence of pro-government paramilitary groups, when there are hundreds of videos and eyewitness reports which attest to their actions.He is committing the same mistake he did when he lost the 1990 presidential election by underestimating the strength of feeling among ordinary Nicaraguans. During that campaign, which I covered, everything had at first pointed to an Ortega win, as crowds would gather to cheer him and his vice-presidential candidate, Sergio Ramírez (who has since turned into a staunch opponent of Mr Ortega).But Mr Ortega's decision to keep military service obligatory resulted in thousands of mothers, who did not want to see their sons risk their lives, voting against the Sandinista leader. Today, you can find all kind of people at the protests, rich, poor, leftists, rightists, old, young, students and workers. Many of those manning the barricades are Sandinistas who believe that Daniel Ortega has betrayed the revolution and its ideals. It is not unusual to meet people who fought Somoza and the Contras at the anti-government marches. Many are there with their children and grandchildren. They draw a clear distinction between those who support the present government - whom they call Orteguistas after the president - and themselves, arguing that they are the ones who are upholding the ideals of the Sandinista revolution and the 20th-Century general, Augusto Sandino, from whom they drew inspiration and their name. Like the Sandinistas who fought Somoza in the the 70s and the Contras in the 80s, those fighting for their basic human rights today are paying a high price for their determination and perseverance. But they are not deterred and have even adopted the battle cry of Sandinista rebel Leonel Rugama, who when he was surrounded by Somoza's troops shouted: \"Let your mother surrender!\"While looking for the home of one of those killed in the recent protests to report on his funeral, I found myself remembering Nadia, the young student who walked among the coffee plants, ready to fight with her rifle, or step on to a landmine, all to defend her ideals of justice and liberty.\"Which side of the barricade would she be on now?\" I asked myself.

            "content": "A fire has gutted the National Museum of Brazil in Rio de Janeiro, the oldest scientific institution in the country.Most of the 20 million items it contained, including the oldest human remains ever found in the Americas, are believed to have been destroyed. The cause of the blaze is not known. No injuries have been reported.The museum, located in a building that once served as the residence for the Portuguese royal family, celebrated its 200th anniversary this year.The fire started on Sunday evening, after the facility had closed for the day. Aerial images broadcast on Brazilian television showed it spreading throughout the building.BREAKING: The National Museum of #Brazil in #Rio is completely consumed in fire. Founded in 1818, the museum is the holder of over 20 million items, including mummies, meteorites, insects, & fossils. So sad to see history in flames :(Video from @g1 live feed#museunacional pic.twitter.com/eCm8G6gKwAEnd of Twitter post  by @JustinFleenorBrazil's President Michel Temer said in a tweet that it was a \"sad day for all Brazilians\" as \"200 years of work, research and knowledge were lost\".Roberto Robadey, a spokesman for the Rio fire department, is quoted by the Associated Press news agency as saying that the hydrants closest to the museum were not working and that firefighters had to get water from a nearby lake.By Monday morning the fire was under control and some of the museum's pieces had been rescued, he added.By Katy Watson, BBC South America correspondentThis isn't just Brazilian history that's gone up in flames. Many see this as a metaphor for the city - and the country as a whole. Rio de Janeiro is in crisis. Growing violence, a deep economic decline and political corruption have combined to make the city a shadow of what it once was. It was only in 2016 that it was hosting the Olympic Games - an event into which Brazil poured billions of dollars. But the hangover from the sporting event has hit Rio hard. Add to that the fact that federal spending has been slashed, and with violence on the rise, tourism numbers have also declined.This was a museum that many saw as long ignored and underfunded - now, with devastating consequences for Brazil's heritage.It was one of the largest museums of natural history and anthropology in the Americas.Its millions of artefacts included fossils, Brazil's largest meteorite, dinosaur bones and a 12,000-year-old skeleton of a woman known as \"Luzia\", the oldest ever discovered in the Americas.The building was also home to items covering the centuries from the arrival of the Portuguese in the 1500s to the declaration of a republic in 1889.The ethnology collection had unique pieces from the pre-Columbian era and artifacts from indigenous cultures.Pieces from Greco-Roman times and Egypt were also on display at the museum.Portugal's royal family transferred the court to the building in 1808, when the country faced with the threat of invasion from Napoleon.The museum was established in 1818, with the aim of promoting scientific research by making its collection available to specialists. Marcelo Moreira - a journalist with TV Globo in Rio - told the BBC: \"It's very sad... This museum has a great history. It represents a lot for Brazilian history and Brazilian culture. It's really a big loss for Brazil.\"In an interview with Globo, the museum's director said it was a \"cultural tragedy\".One museum employee told the network that project managers had had \"tremendous difficulty\" trying to secure funding for \"sufficient\" resources for the palace. Another, librarian Edson Vargas da Silva, is quoted by local media describing the building, which he said had wooden floors and contained \"a lot of things that burn very fast\", such as paper documents. Employees had reportedly previously expressed concern about funding cuts and the dilapidated state of the premises.",

            "title": "Children 'attempting suicide' at Greek refugee camp",
            "content": "At Moria camp on the Greek island of Lesbos, there is deadly violence, overcrowding, appalling sanitary conditions and now a charity says children as young as 10 are attempting suicide. The Victoria Derbyshire programme has been given rare access inside.\"We are always ready to escape, 24 hours a day we have our children ready,\" says Sara Khan, originally from Afghanistan.\"The violence means our little ones don't get to sleep.\" Sara explains that her family spend all day queuing for food at the camp and all night ready to run - in fear of the fights that break out constantly.Conditions are so appalling that charities have actually left in protest. The place smells of raw sewage, and there are around 70 people per toilet, according to medical charity Medecins Sans Frontieres (MSF).Some people live in mobile cabins, but rammed in-between them all are tents and tarpaulin sheets - homes for those who cannot obtain any official living space.The camp is also now sprawling into surrounding countryside. One tent houses 17 people - four families under one canvas.There are currently more than 8,000 people crammed into Moria camp, which was supposed to house around 2,000.A mum describes faeces on the floor of the shelter that she lives in with her tiny 12-day-old baby.The violence in the camp is extreme. In May, hundreds of Kurdish people fled because of a huge battle largely between Arab and Kurdish men. Ali, who has now left the camp, says when he got to Moria with his family \"we found that there was already existing sectarianism and racism, whether it was between Sunnis and Shias, or Kurds, Arabs and Afghans\".He adds that conflict between rebel groups in Syria has also landed inside the gates of the refugee camp. \"It's like the war in Syria and even uglier. We heard about rape cases in there, sexual harassment,\" he says.Watch Catrin's film in full here.On the day we are filming at Moria, yet another fight breaks out in the lunch queue for food. Two people are stabbed - others suffer panic attacks witnessing it. Nearby medical workers are put on standby at MSF.The charity initially left the island in protest at conditions, but has now opened a clinic just outside the gates because the need was so great. The children they are treating have skin conditions caused by the poor hygiene inside, and respiratory diseases from tear gas fired into the camp by police to quell fights. Mental health problems are rife. The workers say they have had to deal with children as young as 10 attempting suicide. \"It's something we're seeing constantly,\" says Luca Fontana, Lesbos co-ordinator for MSF, adding that they are reporting the conditions to the UN refugee agency UNHCR and Greece's ministry of health.\"Despite the fact that we push to move these children to Athens, as soon as possible, it's not happening. Those children are still here.\"The camp opened in 2015 and was initially designed as a transit post for people to stay for a matter of days - but some have been here for years. It is controlled by the Greek government, and the overcrowding is because Greece is enforcing the EU's \"containment\" policy, keeping people on the island rather than transferring them to the Greek mainland.It is part of the EU-Turkey deal which aims to return thousands of refugees to Turkey, and it has been in force since March 2016. From then to July 2018, according to EU figures, 71,645 new refugees arrived in Greece by sea and only 2,224 have been returned to Turkey.George Matthaiou, a Greek government press representative on Moria, concedes conditions are terrible, but blames the EU rather than Greece. \"We don't have the money. You know the situation of Greece, economically,\" he says.\"I want to help but I can do nothing, because the European Union closed the borders.\"Back at the MSF tent, Luca Fontana, who has worked all over the world in conflict zones, says the camp is the worst place he has seen in his life. He worked during the Ebola outbreaks in West Africa but says, \"I've never seen the level of suffering we are witnessing here every day\".\"Even those affected by Ebola still have the hope to survive or they have the support of their family, their society, their village, their relatives.\"Here, the hope is taken away by the system.\"Additional reporting by Leo Sands.Watch the BBC's Victoria Derbyshire programme on weekdays between 09:00 and 11:00 BST on BBC Two and the BBC News Channel in the UK and on iPlayer afterwards.",

            "content": "Israel's public broadcaster has apologised to listeners after music by Richard Wagner was played on the radio. The 19th-Century German composer remains controversial in the country because of his virulent anti-Semitism and because Hitler was a great fan.But on Friday a leading classical music station played part of Wagner's Götterdämmerung (Twilight of the Gods).In its apology, the broadcaster said the editor had erred in his \"artistic choice\" and Wagner would not be played.The Israeli Public Broadcasting Corporation added that it recognised the pain such a broadcast would cause among Holocaust survivors.Wagner's work contains views on racial purity. The composer was also the author of a pamphlet entitled Judaism in Music, in which he said that he said that \"the Jew\" was \"incapable of artistic expression\".Wagner's music is not banned in Israel but is not played due to widespread public opposition. On Friday the presenter on the Kol Hamusica station played a recording of the final act of Götterdämmerung. The piece was directed by Daniel Barenboim - who is Jewish - and performed at the Bayreuth Festival, which celebrates Wagner, in 1991.The subsequent apology was criticised by those who argue that his abhorrent views do not invalidate his work.\"There are just as many Holocaust survivors who love the music as there are those who object to it. You have to listen to his music and his music is absolutely beautiful,\" said Jonathan Livny, head of the Israel Wagner Society.In 2011 an Israeli orchestra played a Wagner composition in Germany. At the time, Israeli Chamber Orchestra Conductor Roberto Paternostro said that while Wagner's ideology was \"terrible\", the aim was \"to divide the man from his art\".",

            "title": "Rohingya crisis: Seeing through the official story in Myanmar",
            "content": "The 300,000 people who have fled Rakhine state to Bangladesh over the past two weeks all come from the northern districts of Maungdaw, Buthidaung and Rathedaung, the last areas of Myanmar with sizeable Rohingya populations not confined to displacement camps. These districts are hard to reach. Roads are poor, and the government requires permits to go there, which journalists rarely get.So we grabbed the opportunity to join a government-organised visit to Maungdaw, for 18 local and foreign journalists. It would mean seeing only places and people they wanted us to see. But sometimes, even under these restrictions, you can glean valuable insights. Besides, the government has arguments that need to be heard. It is now facing an armed insurgency, albeit one some would argue has been self-inflicted. The communal conflict in Rakhine state has a long history, and would be difficult for any government to deal with.On arrival at Sittwe, the Rakhine state capital, we were given instructions. No-one was to leave the group and try to work independently. There was a curfew at 6pm, so no wandering after dark. We could request to go to places that interested us; in practice we found such requests were rejected on grounds of security. To be fair, I believe they were genuinely concerned for our safety.Most of the travel in this low-lying region of Myanmar is along the maze of creeks and rivers on crowded boats. The journey from Sittwe to Buthidaung takes six hours. From there we travelled for an hour on a rough road over the Mayu Hills to Maungdaw. As we drove into the town we passed our first burned village, Myo Thu Gyi. Even the palm trees were scorched.The government's purpose in bringing us was to balance the overwhelmingly negative narrative coming from the Rohingya refugees arriving in Bangladesh, who have almost all spoken of a deliberate campaign of destruction by the Myanmar military and Rakhine mobs, and appalling human rights abuses.But right away these efforts faltered.We were first taken to a small school in Maungdaw, now crowded with displaced Hindu families. They all had the same story to tell of Muslims attacking, of fleeing in fear. Oddly, Hindus who have fled to Bangladesh all say they were attacked by local Rakhine Buddhists, because they resemble Rohingyas. In the school we were accompanied by armed police and officials. Could they speak freely? One man started to tell me how soldiers had been firing at his village, and he was quickly corrected by a neighbour.A woman in an orange, lacy blouse and distinctive grey and mauve longyi was especially animated about the abuses by Muslims.We were then taken to a Buddhist temple, where a monk described Muslims burning down their own homes, nearby. We were given photographs catching them in the act. They looked strange.Men in white haji caps posed as they set light to the palm-thatch roof. Women wearing what appeared to be lacy tablecloths on their heads melodramatically waved swords and machetes. Later I found that one of the women was in fact the animated Hindu woman from the school, and I saw that one of the men had also been present in among the displaced Hindu. They had faked the photos to make it look as though Muslims were doing the burning. We had an audience with Colonel Phone Tint, the local minister for border security. He described how Bengali terrorists, as they call the militants of the Arakan Rohingya Salvation Army, had taken control of Rohingya villages, and forced them to offer one man per household as a fighter. Those who refused to comply have their houses burned, he said. He accused the militants of planting mines and destroying three bridges.I asked whether he was saying that all of the dozens of burned villages had been destroyed by the militants. He confirmed that was the government's position. Responding to a question about military atrocities, he waved it away. \"Where is the proof?\" he asked.  \"Look at those women,\" he meant the Rohingya refugees, \"who are making these claims - would anyone want to rape them?\"The few Muslims we were able to see in Maungdaw were mostly too scared to talk in front of a camera. Breaking away from our minders, we spoke to some who described the hardship of not being allowed to leave their neighbourhood by the security forces, of food shortages, and intense fear.One young man said they had wanted to flee to Bangladesh, but their leaders had signed an agreement with the authorities to stay. In the now quiet Bengali market, I asked a man what he was frightened of. The government, he said.The main destination on our itinerary outside Maungdaw was the coastal town of Alel Than Kyaw. This was one of the places attacked by Arsa militants in the early hours of 25 August. As we approached, we passed village after village, all completely empty. We saw boats, apparently abandoned, along with goats and cattle. There were no people.Alel Than Kyaw had been razed to the ground. Even the clinic, with a sign showing it had been run by the charity Medecins Sans Frontieres, had been destroyed. To the north, in the distance we could see four columns of smoke rising, and heard bursts of automatic weapons fire. More villages being put to the torch, we guessed. Police Lieutenant Aung Kyaw Moe described to us how he had been given advance warning of the attack. He had taken the non-Muslim population for protection into his barracks, and his men fought off the assailants - armed, he said, with guns, swords and home-made explosives, for three hours until they were driven off. Seventeen of the militants lay dead, and one immigration officer. The Muslim population fled shortly afterwards.But he struggled to explain why parts of the town were still smouldering, two weeks after the attack, and in the rainy season. Perhaps a few Muslims stayed on, and then set their homes alight before leaving more recently, he suggested half-heartedly.Then, on our way back from Alel Than Kyaw, something entirely unplanned happened.We spotted black smoke billowing out of some trees, over the rice fields. It was another village going up, right by the road. And the fires had only just started. We all shouted at our police escort to stop the van. When they did, we just ran, leaving our bewildered government minder behind. The police came with us, but then declared it was unsafe to enter the village. So we went ahead of them.The sound of burning and crackling was everywhere. Women's clothing, clearly Muslim, was strewn on the muddy path. And there were muscular young men, holding swords and machetes, standing on the path, baffled by the sight of 18 sweaty journalists rushing towards them. They tried to avoid being filmed, and two of them dashed further into the village, bringing out the last of their group and making a hasty exit.They said they were Rakhine Buddhists. One of my colleagues managed a quick conversation with one of them, who admitted they had set the houses on fire, with the help of the police.As we walked in, we could see the roof of the madrassa had just been set alight. School texts with Arabic script had been thrown outside. An empty plastic jug, reeking of petrol, had been left on the path.The village was called Gawdu Thar Ya. It was a Muslim village. There was no sign of the inhabitants. The Rakhine men who had torched the village walked out, past our police escort, some carrying household items they had looted. The burning took place close to a number of large police barracks. No-one did anything to stop it.",

            "title": "How Libya holds the key to solving Europe's migration crisis",
            "content": "The European Union wants to set up migrant \"reception centres\" in North Africa to process the thousands of Africans trying to reach Europe. This has been rejected by Libya, where people-smuggling networks once controlled by former strongman Muammar Gaddafi, are now able to operate freely, writes the BBC's Farouk Chothia.  As he appealed to Nato not to launch air strikes to overthrow his regime, then-Libyan leader Muammar Gaddafi said: \"Now listen, you people of Nato. You're bombing a wall which stood in the way of African migration to Europe and in the way of al-Qaeda terrorists. This wall was Libya. You're breaking it.\"Gaddafi was trying to exploit European fears about migration in the hope of clinging to power, but it did not work. He was killed by Nato-backed militias in October 2011 following a popular uprising against his 42-year rule. As a result, Europe - especially Italy - lost a key partner in efforts to reduce migration from Africa. \"Not enough attention was paid to Libya after Gaddafi's overthrow,\" Tarek Megersi, a Libyan analyst with the UK-based European Council on Foreign Relations think-tank, told the BBC. \"There is a lack of governance structures and smuggling groups have exploited this to the maximum,\" Mr Megersi added. Unlike Turkey which has stemmed the flow of migrants by agreeing to take back Syrians who reach the Greek islands in exchange for a huge financial package, Libya's weak internationally recognised government has rejected a European Union proposal to set up \"reception centres\" for African migrants while European states consider their asylum applications.'We categorically reject camps for migrants,'' Libya's Deputy Prime Minister Ahmed Maiteeq said, following talks with Italy's far-right interior minister Matteo Salvini in Tripoli last week. ''It is not allowed by Libyan law,\" he added.A further complication is the breakdown in law and order in Libya, where a host of rival militias are largely able to operate as they please, with some making huge amounts of money from the migrant trade.Mr Megersi said migrants have rapidly changed the demographics of parts of Libya. The coastal city of Zawiya, which used to have a population of about 200,000, now has more than one million migrants living in it, and the surrounding area. \"They [Libyans] have the same fear as European states,\" he added.Speaking after an African Union (AU) summit in Mauritania on Monday, Morocco's Foreign Minister Nasser Bourita also rejected the EU proposal, describing it as \"an easy, counter-productive solution\", although some poor states along the migration route - Niger is rumoured to be one of them - might eventually agree to host the \"reception centres\". Gaddafi signed a \"friendship\" agreement with then-Italian Prime Minister Silvio Berlusconi in August 2008, in a deal which saw his regime tightening border controls - including joint maritime patrols - in exchange for Italy pledging $5bn (£3.75bn) in compensation for colonial-era crimes. The deal led to a sharp decline in the number of people trying to reach Europe by boat -  from nearly 40,000 in 2008 to 3,200 in the first seven months after joint patrols started in 2009, according to EU-funded research.In total, 206,880 people left Libyan shores between 2003 and 2012, an average of about 23,000 a year. Almost all of them - 190,425 - went to the Italian island of Lampedusa and the remaining 16,445 to Malta, other research shows. Mr Megersi said Gaddafi used migration \"to hold Europe hostage\", allowing smuggling networks - made up of people from the two main ethnic groups in the south-west, the Tuareg and Tebu - to thrive when it suited him.\"The tribes of southern Libya have historically been smugglers because of a lack of economic opportunities and development,\" Mr Megersi told the BBC.\"Gaddafi made a deal with them - smuggle goods to Niger, Chad and Algeria, rather than people to Europe. He will give them petrol or flour at subsidised prices, which they will then sell at market prices.\"The vacuum left by Gaddafi was never filled by any entity capable of exerting control or pressure over them,\" Mr Megersi said. According to UN figures, about 15,151 people left North Africa - mainly Libya - by boat in 2012, which many Libyans described as the \"golden year\" after Gaddafi's overthrow. In 2014, the number rose to a staggering  170,110. This was because conflict escalated between rival governments and militias jostling for power following disputed elections. The fighting was so intense that the US shut its embassy and evacuated its diplomats to neighbouring Tunisia.In a report published last year following a study on migration trends, the UN High Commission for Refugees said: \"Libya has for decades drawn people from neighbouring countries, as it offered the best employment opportunities and highest salaries in the region - although it has been increasingly roiled by instability and insecurity since the ouster of Muammar Gaddafi in 2011.\"The study found that around half of those travelling to Libya do so believing they can find jobs there, but end up fleeing onwards to Europe to escape life-threatening dangers and difficult economic conditions plus widespread exploitation and abuse.\" Smuggling networks operating across East and West Africa bring the migrants by road to Libya, from countries as diverse as Eritrea - a small state which young people flee to avoid military conscription - and Nigeria, Africa's most populous state which is battling high levels of unemployment, an Islamist-led insurgency and clashes between herders and farmers.      Efforts to break up the networks in Libya and other states have yielded results.\"Certain militias [in Libya] have been given incentives to stop human-trafficking and have been co-opted into law-enforcement activities, but what these incentives are remains unclear,\" Mark Micallef, a Malta-based researcher with the Global Initiative Against Transnational Organised Crime think-tank, told the BBC. Sudan - led by Omar al-Bashir, who is wanted by the International Criminal Courts for war crimes in Darfur - has also cooperated with the EU.\"Over the past two years, Sudan has been cracking down on its northern border with Chad, Libya and Egypt,\" Mr Micallef said. \"It has taken the opportunity to come out of isolation and engage with the international community.\"Niger - which is second from bottom on the UN Human Development Index - has also \"played more than its part\", despite the \"very big hit\" this has had on the economy in its northern Agadez region, which was heavily dependent on migrants en route to Libya, Mr Micallef said.In exchange, the EU offered 610m euros (£540m; $714m) to Niger in 2016 from a fund set up to address what it calls the root causes of \"destabilisation, forced displacement and irregular migration\" in 26 African states. This included tackling population growth, \"extreme poverty\" and  weak \"economic infrastructure\", the EU said on its website.Significantly, the number of boat migrants has dropped in the first six months of this year. Less than 50,000 people arrived in Europe from North Africa, suggesting that if there is no major outbreak of violence in Libya ahead of elections scheduled for December, sea crossings in 2018 could be at their lowest since 2014.  More on the migration crisis: For its part, the AU decided at its summit to establish the African Observatory for Migration and Development in a bid to coordinate its response to the crisis.\"Africa should not just react to decisions taken outside. We should have our own narrative,\" Mr Bourita, Morocco's foreign minister, told the BBC.To curb migration, African states needed to invest in young people, who were \"an energy\", Mr Bourita said. \"Either you use it properly and it can be an element of development or you will not control it and it will be a problem for all the countries,\" he added. In a report published last month after a survey in nine African states, Afrobarometer, a South African-based non-governmental organisation, said the continent needed \"thriving\" economies to stem migration. The desire to migrate was strongest among the young and the educated, with 43% of respondents citing the need to find a job as the main reason and 33% saying they wanted to escape economic hardship and poverty, the report said. Most southern Africans preferred to settle in another African state, while those from West and east Africa preferred to go to Europe and North America, the report added. Mr Megersi believes that the EU should place greater emphasis on creating legal avenues for migration in order to boost its workforce. \"Some do it for asylum. Others for economic reasons. They are young men eager and willing to work in different spheres. Europe needs migration, with its ageing population,\" he said. But the current political climate in Europe mitigates against this, with many voters blaming migrants for their economic problems. This has led to the rise of right-wing parties - like Mr Salvini's League party in Italy - and efforts to curb migration are likely to intensify.\"Populists are gaining ground by holding a firm line, and you have one ad hoc measure after another. Migration policy in Europe is a game of politics,\" Mr Megersi added.",

            "title": "Myanmar Rohingya: How a 'genocide' was investigated",
            "content": "Indiscriminate killing; villages burned to the ground; children assaulted; women gang-raped - these are the findings of United Nations investigators who allege that \"the gravest crimes under international law\" were committed in Myanmar last August.Such was their severity, the report said, the army must be investigated for genocide against the Rohingya Muslims in the western Rakhine state.The investigators' conclusions came despite them not being granted access to Myanmar by the government there, which has since rejected the report.This is how the investigators came to their conclusions.On 24 March 2017, the UN Human Rights Council agreed to form an independent fact-finding mission on Myanmar to look into \"alleged recent human rights violations by military and security forces\".Five months after the mission was formed, Myanmar's army launched a major assault on Rakhine state, following deadly attacks by Rohingya militants on police posts.The military's campaign became the main focus of the investigation, which also looked into rights abuses in Kachin and Shan states.The mission wrote to Myanmar's government three times asking for access to the country. It received no response.\"The first rule was 'do no harm',\" says Christopher Sidoti, one of the three people who headed the investigation.\"Those people we spoke to had been heavily traumatised, and if our staff considered that an interview would be re-traumatising, it wouldn't have been conducted.\"No evidence is so important that it warrants re-traumatising someone who has gone through all these experiences.\"At least 725,000 people have fled Rakhine state over the past 12 months, many to neighbouring Bangladesh. As a result, despite not getting access to Myanmar, investigators were able to gather a vast amount of testimony from people who had experienced violence at first-hand before fleeing.They spoke to 875 people in Bangladesh, Malaysia, Thailand, Indonesia and the UK, and made a decision early on that the most valuable testimony would come from people who had not shared their stories before.\"We didn't want to interview people who had been interviewed by other organisations,\" Mr Sidoti, an Australian human rights law expert, says. \"We didn't want a situation where people's evidence could have been tainted.\"We tried to get people from a wide variety of areas and when we became more and more focused later on, we would deliberately, through a community network, seek out others from that area to get a better picture of what went on.\"\"We would never use just one account as proof,\" Mr Sidoti says. \"We always sought corroboration from primary and secondary sources.\"Those sources included videos, photographs, documents and satellite images, which showed the destruction of Rohingya villages over several months in 2017.In one case, investigators had received several reports from refugees in Cox's Bazar, Bangladesh, that a village had been destroyed in particular circumstances at a particular time.Investigators were then able to source satellite images that corroborated what witnesses had said.Satellites images showed that:Getting hold of photographic evidence from the ground proved to be more of a challenge.\"When people were leaving Rakhine state, they were being stopped, searched and deprived of their money, gold and mobile phones,\" Mr Sidoti says. \"It seemed pretty clear this was an attempt to get video or photographic evidence they had recorded.\"There wasn't much left but we made use of it.\"The report names six senior military figures it believes should go on trial, including Commander-in-Chief Min Aung Hlaing and his deputy.How were investigators able to point the finger directly at these men?The case here is not based on a paper trail, or a recording, but instead on research.Investigators relied heavily on others' detailed understanding of how Myanmar's government works. Among them was a military adviser who had co-operated with war crimes tribunals in the past.\"We have been able to access extraordinary international advice on various aspects of Myanmar's military,\" Mr Sidoti says. \"The conclusion we have come up with is that the army is so tightly controlled that nothing happens involving the army in Myanmar without the commander-in-chief and his deputies knowing.\"While the people believed to have given the orders have been named, work is ongoing to identify the members of the military who may have committed atrocities.\"We do have a list of alleged perpetrators on the ground and they will remain confidential for now,\" Mr Sidoti says. \"Their names have come up frequently enough for them to be put on lists to face more investigation.\"Identifying what appears to be genocide and proving that what happened fits the legal definition of genocide are two different things.\"Evidence of crimes against humanity was very quickly obtained and was quite overwhelming,\" Mr Sidoti says. \"Genocide is a much more legally complex issue.\"As the report states, genocide is when \"a person commits a prohibited act with the intent to destroy, in whole or in part, a national, ethnical, racial or religious group\".The key word is \"intent\". Investigators believe the evidence of that intent by the Myanmar army is clear.They cite statements by commanders and suspected perpetrators, and the degree of planning required to carry out such an operation. But still, identifying a genocide from a legal perspective took a significant amount of legal work.\"We arrived at a position we had not expected to be in when we were beginning,\" Mr Sidoti says. \"None of the three of us thought the evidence for genocide would be as strong as it was. That came as a surprise.\"The report says that the six military officials should face trial. It also condemns Myanmar's de facto leader, Nobel Peace Prize laureate Aung San Suu Kyi, for failing to intervene to stop attacks, and the UN's outgoing rights chief this week said she should have resigned as a result.The report also makes a series of recommendations, including the referral of the investigation to the International Criminal Court or to a new tribunal, and the imposition of an arms embargo.However, China has so far resisted strong action against its neighbour and ally Myanmar on the UN Security Council, where it holds a veto.Mr Sidoti acknowledges that officials in Myanmar are unlikely to investigate the allegations themselves. Last year, an internal investigation by the army exonerated itself of blame in the Rohingya crisis, and Myanmar's Permanent Representative to the UN last week told BBC Burmese the report was full of \"one-sided accusations against us\".\"We have made recommendations and it is up to others to act on them,\" Mr Sidoti says. \"I have a high expectation that the Security Council will act on its responsibilities. But I'm not naive.\"",

            "title": "Letter from Africa: How bruised is President Buhari by defections?",
            "content": "In our series of letters from African journalists, editor-in-chief of Nigeria's Daily Trust newspaper Mannir Dan Ali considers President Muhammadu Buhari's chances of re-election after the loss of key allies. The dramatic defections of nearly 50 legislators last week from Nigeria's ruling party looked for a moment like history was repeating itself. There had been hints for weeks that defections were on the cards.Key members of President Muhammadu Buhari's All Progressive Congress (APC) party, who were aggrieved by his leadership, wanted to deal a powerful body blow in the run-up to next year's polls. A similar strategy had weakened the People's Democratic Party (PDP) when it was in power, leading to its defeat in the 2015 elections.However, when the defections finally happened, they were not as seismic as in 2015 when five influential state governors and at least two political kingmakers opened the floodgates for others to follow. So far around four dozen members of the national assembly have switched sides from the APC mainly to the opposition PDP.The governor of the north-central state of Benue has also defected and at least two other governors may follow. Interestingly, the leaders of both the lower and upper houses of the national assembly, Yakubu Dogara and Bukola Saraki respectively, have not announced their defection - despite the fact that they were seen as the instigators of the current crisis. But they are both now viewed with suspicion - and there are calls for them to be expelled from the party so that their positions could be taken by core APC loyalists.\"Mr Buhari has been unable to put a lid on the competing ambitions within the party - as some governors and their political backers try to gain the upper hand with an eye to the presidency in 2023\"It is no secret that Mr Saraki does not see eye-to-eye with the president. He has just been cleared by the Supreme Court of corruption following an investigation initiated by Mr Buhari. Their tense relationship has meant that many important laws and appointments are being held up by parliament.Such delays are only going to worsen as both houses of parliament went into an abrupt eight-week recess immediately after the defections.Among the business now in limbo is one for the approval of money for the electoral commission to conduct the February 2019 election. And with party primaries due in the next few weeks, more turbulence is expected.The defectors have one thing on their minds - they want to secure their own political futures.They had figured out they were unlikely to secure nomination for the posts they were gunning for. Their key demand was an automatic ticket to run in the next election, but the APC refused.Many of them had joined the APC from the PDP, and feel their loyalty has not been rewarded.But Mr Buhari has been unable to put a lid on the competing ambitions within the party - as some governors and their political backers try to gain the upper hand with an eye to the presidency in 2023.Since the return to civilian rule in 1999, it is the powerful state governors who tend to have the most influence in their parties.Members of parliament just do not carry as much weight - and as consequence suffer from a high attrition rate, with only between 20 and 30% of them securing  a second term.  Despite these defections, the ruling party has said it is not worried as it still has a majority in both houses.This was exactly the position taken by the PDP before it went on to stare defeat in the face in 2015.For President Buhari and the APC to avoid a similar fate, they will need to do more to reassure their members and other Nigerians that they can be trusted with power beyond 2019. The president's patchy performance has meant that many Nigerians are not as enthused about the coming election as they were in 2015. Then they were full of hope. A Buhari presidency promised a tough stance on corruption, insecurity and to revitalise the economy.President Buhari has had limited success in the first two and the economy has worsened with unemployment at an all-time high.The only reason the president and his party may just win next February is that the opposition has yet to put up a credible alternative.There are also Nigerians who are unlikely to be able to bring themselves to vote for the PDP, blamed for creating a lot of the mess during its 16 years in power.With party primaries scheduled to take place between August and October, it is getting very late in the day for the opposition to find someone with the credibility and national name recognition to appeal to most Nigerians and the big power brokers who are a big factor in the elections.More from Mannir Dan Ali:Follow us on Twitter @BBCAfrica, on Facebook at BBC Africa or on Instagram at bbcafrica",

            "title": "Myanmar Rohingya: What will happen next after damning UN report?",
            "content": "After the United Nations released a damning report into the violence against Rohingya Muslims in Myanmar, we asked BBC South East Asia correspondent Jonathan Head and Geneva correspondent Imogen Foulkes what could happen next. Jonathan Head: The report is unusually strong; the authors do not mince their words, describing the Myanmar military in the most damning terms. They say there is a strong case for a genocide prosecution, and emphasise that accountability for the military inside Myanmar is impossible, and must therefore be pursued by the international community.Expect more energetic diplomacy at the UN, both in the Security Council and the General Assembly, to find a way to do this. The Myanmar government has rejected previous international reports documenting abuses against the Rohingya, but this one, compiled over more than a year, headed by three respected international legal experts, and likely to get public support at the UN, will be harder to dismiss.The report also condemns all of Myanmar's own inquiries into the abuses as worthless, making it harder for the government to take refuge behind them. The report compounds Myanmar's international isolation and puts its military leaders in the very worst category of human rights abusers, but will not significantly change the dynamics inside the country.Imogen Foulkes: The UN investigators say the situation in Myanmar should be referred to the International Criminal Court, a move which would have to be approved by the UN Security Council. It is more than likely that one of the five permanent council members, China, would veto such a move. Failing a referral to the ICC, the investigators suggest an independent criminal tribunal should be set up, as with Rwanda or former Yugoslavia.Such a tribunal could in theory be created by the UN General Assembly, avoiding a Security Council veto. For a tribunal to really function, however, Myanmar would have to co-operate, by ensuring that those indicted did turn up for trial. It took many years, and promises of a closer relationship with the EU, before Serbia and Croatia handed over their suspected war criminals to the Hague's tribunal.Imogen Foulkes: By naming six senior military figures, including the commander in chief of Myanmar's armed forces and his deputy, this UN team has gone further than any other. There have been many investigations into war crimes in Syria, and we know there is a long list of suspects, including, it is thought, very senior figures in the Syrian military and the government. But their names have never been made public. The Myanmar investigators must believe they can achieve something by naming names. Within hours of the report being published, there have already been consequences. The European Union is to hold a meeting this week, and will hear in person from the UN team. Facebook has removed accounts associated with Myanmar military leaders. A key concern in the UN report is the dissemination of misinformation designed to incite hate.Other possible actions could include sanctions, something the UN investigators also call for. The EU, or the UN Security Council, could impose travel bans on those named in the report, and could also freeze their financial assets. Imogen Foulkes: No-one can be convicted without the ICC or another form of tribunal. The UN team can investigate, but not prosecute. But the sheer weight of evidence gathered suggests there will have to be some form of prosecution, although it could be many years away.Jonathan Head: It's very unlikely Aung Sang Suu Kyi will face prosecution. The report acknowledges that the civilian government has no authority over the military in Myanmar, and that there is no evidence it knew of the military's plans to attack the Rohingya population. It does accuse her of failing to use her moral authority to curb the abuses, and says her government contributed to the crimes in Rakhine state by spreading false narratives, blocking independent investigations and denying the military's wrongdoing.The authors say their main focus for prosecutions must be on the military, which it finds primarily responsible. Perhaps the worst effect of this for Ms Suu Kyi is that she now finds herself in the same camp as men accused of the very worst human rights crimes, because she has insisted on backing the military's version of events in Rakhine. She could conceivably have supported the military's right to respond robustly to attacks by Rohingya militants last year while leaving the door open to credible investigations of human rights violations. She did not, and her international reputation has gone from being tarnished last year, to being shattered by this report.Imogen Foulkes: The UN may be hoping that this report helps Aung San Suu Kyi understand that if she wants to stay in power, or to exercise power more meaningfully than she has done so far, then she must support war crimes prosecutions. A first step could be for her to back the investigators' call for the resignation of Commander in Chief Min Aung Hlaing.Imogen Foulkes: Genocide is a very specific crime under international law. To show that genocide has occurred, intent to exterminate an entire group must be shown. Random violence, an army rampaging through a village, would not constitute genocide. But a co-ordinated campaign, with a clear line of command from senior generals to troops on the ground to persecute, kill, or deport a group (usually based on race, religion or ethnicity) would.In the case of Myanmar, the investigators said that factors \"pointing at such intent include the broader oppressive context and hate rhetoric; specific utterances of commanders and direct perpetrators; exclusionary policies, including to alter the demographic composition of Rakhine state; the level of organization indicating a plan for destruction; and the extreme scale and brutality of the violence\".Read more: Why the word 'genocide' is used so carefullyJonathan Head: The situation for Rohingya on both sides of the border with Bangladesh is dire. Inside Rakhine they live in fear, without legal status and subject to arbitrary restrictions on their movements and possibly worse. About 140,000 are confined to dismal camps, where they fled in the communal violence of 2012, whereas the much smaller number of Rakhine people displaced by the conflict have been re-housed or able to go back to their homes.In Bangladesh the population of refugees is many times too large for the area of land they occupy. They are sustained by a massive international aid effort, which at least offers food, shelter, education and medical treatment - the last two near-impossible to obtain when they lived in Myanmar. But they are constantly vulnerable to weather, environmental degradation, the abuses of organised gangs within the camps, and to the possibility that Bangladesh may one day make good its threat to move them all to a semi-submerged island which is even less suitable.The two countries have agreed to repatriate the refugees, but Myanmar is still tightly restricting access to Rakhine for most international agencies, and unwilling to address the terrible abuses that forced the Rohingya to flee. Buddhist resentment of the Rohingya in Rakhine has hardened and no effort is being made to persuade them to accept them back. In these conditions a return to Rakhine for the Rohingya is impossible to imagine, and they are stuck in limbo. A huge diaspora living in squalid camps can spell trouble in the long-term, as the fate of Palestinian refugees suggests.",

            "title": "China censorship after Xi Jinping presidency extension proposal",
            "content": "China's governing Communist Party has proposed removing a clause in the constitution which limits presidencies to two five-year terms - which means President Xi Jinping could remain as leader after the end of his second term in 2023. The controversial move has ignited discussion on Chinese social media and pushed online government censors into overdrive. Several key terms have suddenly been subjected to heavy censorship on Sina Weibo, China's Twitter-like microblog since Sunday. According to censorship-monitoring websites China Digital Times and Free Weibo, censored phrases include:So what's going on?The tradition of limiting China's presidencies to 10 years emerged in the 1990s, when veteran leader Deng Xiaoping sought to avoid a repeat of the chaos that had marked the Mao era and its immediate aftermath.Since Xi Jinping came to power in 2012 he has shown a readiness to write his own rules.But many observers have been alarmed at the prospect of Mr Xi becoming an \"emperor for life\", and critics have suggested this could set China's development back a century. China employs millions of people to monitor and censor internet activity. So it's not surprising that overtly critical posts, such as these two, were blocked:References to emperors, and 19th Century warlord Yuan Shikai, who notoriously tried to restore monarchy, are also being blocked, after censors clocked on that they were cryptic references to Xi Jinping, such as this one:Even posts using the phrase \"emigration\" have been censored - after several users alleged that there had been a spike in web users searching for \"emigration\" on search engine Baidu since the announcement was made. And what do censors have against Winnie the Pooh? Well, it's a nickname that social media users have coined for President Xi, which is often used derogatively. If you search for the phrase \"Winnie the Pooh\" on Sina Weibo, the site brings up a message saying: \"According to relevant laws, regulations and policies... search results are not displayed\".So what is allowed?The comments remaining on the popular Sina Weibo microblog are mostly monosyllabic statements from users simply say they \"like\" or \"approve\" the amendments. The snooker queen on top of the worldLift peeing video ignites fury in ChinaNZ reacts to 'creepy' PM Ardern interviewThey are likely to be from China's \"50 Cent Party\" - a nickname coined for internet commentators who are paid small amounts to post messages supporting the government's position. Some posts have attracted thousands of comments - but only a few are available to view. This is traditionally indicative of online censorship by government administrators. The way the proposed changes were announced on Sunday also appeared to be carefully planned.Whereas English-language media such as broadcaster CGTN prominently reported the removal of the requirement that presidents and vice presidents \"shall serve no more than two consecutive terms\", its Chinese-language equivalent did not highlight it. Instead, broadcaster CCTV instead issued the full list of amendments that were being made to the constitution, with the abolition of presidential terms listed 14th in 21 total proposed amendments. China's state-run Global Times has argued that the change does not mean \"that the Chinese president will have a lifelong tenure\". The paper quoted Su Wei, a Communist Party academic and party member, as saying it was a significant decision as China needed a \"stable, strong and consistent leadership\" from 2020-2035.BBC Monitoring reports and analyses news from TV, radio, web and print media around the world.

            "content": "Operating out of a small room in an unknown country, a new internet radio station broadcasts a programme aimed at campaigning for greater women's rights in Saudi Arabia.With melancholy music playing in the background, the presenter of Nsawya FM (Feminism FM) addresses the issue of domestic violence in the Gulf kingdom.The presenter's voice shakes with emotion as she discusses the fate of Sara, a woman she says was killed by a male relative.She was a 33-year-old university graduate with a job who lived with her parents - and who wanted to marry a man with a different nationality, that of Yemen.\"Sara's dream was ended with five bullets shot by her 22-year-old brother, even though she had been officially engaged with the consent of her parents,\" Ashtar, a 27 year old who uses a pseudonym inspired by the Mesopotamian goddess of love and war, later told BBC Arabic by phone.The case was reported by the media and discussed by people who knew her, Ashtar said.The presenter also told the story of Hanan Shahri, who is reported to have killed herself in 2013 after her brother and uncle allegedly beat her and refused to allow her to marry her fiancé.Such cases, Ashtar said, were \"only the tip of the iceberg\".Three weeks ago, Nsawya FM set up a Twitter account and announced it would broadcast a weekly programme that would be the \"voice of the silent majority\". It also called for volunteers who wanted to get involved in production or contribute material.In the past two weeks, the station has broadcast two one-hour programmes using only a microphone, a laptop with editing software and the live audio streaming website Mixlr. The poor quality of the sound and the whole production, in general, reflects the non-professional nature of this project.Ashtar said they did not expect a massive audience initially, and were instead aiming for \"gradual growth\" as the programme spread awareness on women's rights.\"We started this project to archive this phase for history, so that people would know we were real, we did exist,\" explained Ashtar, who did not want so share any details about her own identity despite living outside the kingdom because she feared reprisals.\"The Saudi authorities could ban Twitter at any moment and we would lose the archive of our thoughts. Whereas the radio gives us the opportunity to record programmes and broadcast them on other platforms,\" she added.At least 17 human rights defenders and women's rights activists critical of the Saudi government have been arrested or detained since mid-May, according to the UN. Several of them have been accused of serious crimes, including \"suspicious contact with foreign parties\", and could face up to 20 years in prison if convicted.  Nsawya FM has two presenters and nine women producing content. All but two of the women are Saudi nationals, and some of the women live in Saudi Arabia.The women say communication between them is difficult because they live in different time zones and some have other demands on their time, including studies or work.Ashtar described herself as \"an activist who uses the media to express her ideas\".She said she had sent articles to a number of leading Lebanese publications in recent years but that none of them had ended up being used. She believed that the rejections were the result of her \"confrontational\" ideas about society, religion and politics.Ashtar expressed admiration for the \"the Matriarchal era\" - an apparent reference to a period in pre-Islamic Arabia when women were the leaders of their tribes.\"I believe that women are better than men. If women were to hold power again, especially in certain sectors like the judiciary, this world would be a better place,\" she explained.Ashtar said she did not hide her beliefs from her family and took the opportunity to debate them with relatives at gatherings for Eid al-Fitr and other festivals.But her family rejected them. \"The West has brainwashed you,\" they used to tell her.Now that the ban on women driving has been lifted by King Salman, activists like Ashtar are campaigning to for an end to the male guardianship system, which they say is discriminatory. Under the system, men are given the authority to make a range of critical decisions on behalf of their female relatives.The activists have taken their campaign to Twitter, the most popular social media platform in Saudi Arabia. Saudi women are very active there.However, many people in the kingdom frown on women using the site to push for reforms. Some have denounced the activists as \"spies\" and \"not Saudis\", or described them as \"electronic flies\" in an attempt to play down their significance.Others have urged them to wait and give the king a chance to enact further reforms.\"This is a mere propaganda. We are Saudis and we know it,\" Ashtar said.\"Had he wanted to, the king could have abolished the guardianship system. This does not need decades of discussions and consultations. All it takes is one signature.\"",

            "content": "Senator John McCain has been buried at the US Naval Academy in Annapolis, Maryland, after a small private ceremony.A military flypast was performed with the squadron one plane short, to symbolise the dead senator.Mr McCain graduated from the elite Naval Academy in 1958, later serving in Vietnam as a fighter jet pilot.Family and friends were joined by his classmates and the current midshipmen for a service at the school's chapel.It caps a week of memorials for Mr McCain, who died on 25 August, aged 81, from the effects of brain cancer.On Saturday, heavyweights from across the political spectrum gathered at the Washington National Cathedral to remember the Arizona senator, who became one of America's most high-profile politicians. Two former presidents - George W Bush and Barack Obama - paid tribute to Mr McCain's courage and sense of honour. A eulogy by the statesman's daughter Meghan, one of his seven children, included a thinly veiled swipe at President Donald Trump.\"The America of John McCain has no need to be made great again, because America was always great,\" she said.Crowds lined the route as the senator's final motorcade travelled to the academy in Annapolis.  Mr McCain was buried next to his classmate and friend, Admiral Chuck Larson, who reserved four plots in the idyllic cemetery for the pair and their wives before his death in 2014.\"Chuck has his wingman back now,\" the late admiral's widow, Sarah Larson, told CNN.Mr McCain's sons Jack and Don were scheduled to pay tribute to him at the Sunday ceremony, alongside retired Army General David Petraeus and Senator Lindsey Graham, a long-time friend.President Trump - who had major personal and political differences with Mr McCain - has spent the weekend at his private golf course in Virginia, and did not attend.Former US Senator Joseph Lieberman, a friend and colleague of Mr McCain who also gave a eulogy at Saturday's service, told CNN on Sunday: \"I say goodbye and my heart will be heavy. I'll shed a tear and yet I'll thank God that I knew a man like John McCain so well.\"",

            "title": "How will the US move to cut aid affect Pakistan?",
            "content": "The Trump administration says it is cutting almost all security aid to Pakistan until it deals with terrorist networks operating on its soil. But will the cuts have any impact, asks the BBC's M Ilyas Khan.The US has yet to announce exactly how much aid will be cut - but defence experts believe the total impact of the visible aid suspension may fall in the range of more than $900m (£660m).This includes the suspension of $255m due to Pakistan for military equipment and training under the Foreign Military Financing (FMF) fund, and $700m under the Coalition Support Fund (CSF) - paid to Pakistan for conducting operations against militant groups.Experts believe the total financial impact of an adverse US policy on Pakistan could be much higher than this though, especially as the US state department has said an unspecified amount of other security assistance managed by the department of defence could be cut.Security experts believe the cuts are likely to put a squeeze on the Pakistani military, at least in the short run.\"If the US pipeline dries up, the military's immediate plans for upgrading of materiel and manpower resources will be stalled,\" says Prof Hasan Askari Rizvi, a defence analyst and author of the book, Military, State and Society in Pakistan.\"It will also be a setback in the long term as China or any other friendly country cannot totally replace the resources that Pakistan needs to keep its military machine well oiled,\" he says.This could explain the government's response to the cuts. While Pakistani politicians have been quick to condemn the US in the media, with Foreign Minister Khwaja Asif calling the US a \"friend-killer\" whose attitude \"matches neither that of a friend nor an ally\" and Defence Minister Khurram Dastgir warning against \"American mischief\", other government reaction has been more cautious.The foreign office talked of Pakistan's efforts to bring peace to the region, which it said was done mostly at its own cost - $120bn over 15 years - and argued that \"arbitrary deadlines, unilateral pronouncements and shifting goalposts are counterproductive in addressing common threats\".Meanwhile, in a written reply to the BBC an army spokesman said Pakistan had \"never fought for money but for peace\".Experts believe that, despite the verbal sparring on TV, the military will actually be tempted to put a squeeze on militant groups that are believed to have sanctuaries, recruitment and training facilities on Pakistani soil - just as the US has demanded.\"Though it may not be visible, there certainly will be some changes in Pakistan's approach to militants,\" says Prof Askari.\"At the very least, they may ask groups like the Haqqani network to go low-key for a while.\" Pakistan's main leverage with the US lies in its geographical location and its role in Afghanistan - the fact that it controls the only supply line into the landlocked country for international troops, and has influence over the militant groups that are fighting there.The question is, will Pakistan try to press its advantage by shutting overland access of US supplies to Kabul?It's happened before. Pakistan blocked this route for several months in 2011 and 2012 after a series of embarrassing events, including the killing of Osama Bin Laden in a secret operation by US Navy Seals, and the bombing of a Pakistani post by American jets that killed more than 20 soldiers.But Prof Askari believes Pakistan may not take that route this time. In 2011, the US appeared more accommodating, following Pakistani anger at the US operation and the bombing of the post.But this time, the anger is coming from the US side - and too drastic a move from Pakistan could aggravate the situation.\"Pakistanis may create hurdles or cause delays in the transit of such supplies, but they are unlikely to block it completely, because that could lead to suspension of all ties,\" Prof Askari says.At the moment, the US is still providing Pakistan with non-military aid. And even in the case of military assistance, it is believed the US may follow a \"condition and issue-based approach\" where funds would be released for identified and measurable actions.By contrast, a total cut-off of relations would mean that the US could remove Pakistan from its list of major non-Nato allies, designate it as a state sponsor of terrorism, or work with India and Afghanistan to more aggressively counter its interests in the region.Neither side is likely to want such a drastic move.Analysts have pointed out that the US does not want instability in Pakistan. Pakistan has one of the world's fastest-growing nuclear programmes, as well as several Islamist terrorist organisations on its soil, so \"America and its allies are rightly concerned that any instability in Pakistan may result in terrorists getting their hands on Pakistan's nuclear technology\", Christine Fair, a US-based South Asia expert, says.",

            "content": "Talks between the US and Canada about amending the North American Free Trade Agreement (Nafta) have ended for the week without reaching a deal.US officials said they would meet their Canadian counterparts again next week in an effort to reach agreement. For now, the US plans to move forward with a deal with Mexico on terms reached earlier in the week.It's not clear what this means for the trilateral agreement, which governs more than $1tr (£770bn) in trade.The White House had faced a Friday deadline to provide Congress with the necessary 90 days' notice that it intended to enter into a new trade agreement and still have the new Nafta deal signed by 1 December, the day Mexico's new left-wing President Andres Manuel Lopez Obrador takes office.The US wants Canada to open up access to US dairy products, extend patent protections for medicines and agree to eliminate international panels to resolve most disputes between investors and governments.Dairy in particular appeared to be an issue on Friday, with US officials saying Canada had made no concessions on agriculture and Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau saying he was standing firm on the issue. Canadian Foreign Affairs Minister Chrystia Freeland said on Friday afternoon that the two countries are making progress and that an agreement is \"within reach\". \"With goodwill and flexibility on all sides we can get there,\" she said. She also said Canada does not feel the same deadline pressure as the US.\"For Canada, the focus is on getting a good deal and once we have a good deal for Canada, we'll be done,\" she said.President Donald Trump notified Congress on Friday that he intended to sign a new trade agreement with Mexico in 90 days, and Canada \"if it is willing\", US Trade Representative Robert Lighthizer said.He said talks with Canada this week had been \"constructive\". Officials said the US is on track to present text of the agreement in 30 days.\"Our officials are continuing to work toward agreement.  The USTR team will meet with Minister Freeland and her colleagues Wednesday of next week,\" Mr Lighthizer said.Mr Trump said earlier this week he was willing to cut Canada out of the pact. But it is not clear whether Congress, which has final say over trade agreements, will accept a deal if Canada is not part of it. Several senators have questioned whether the White House has the authority to negotiate a deal without Canada.Business groups have also said it is critical that Canada be part of any agreement.\"Anything other than a trilateral agreement won't win Congressional approval and would lose business support,\" said Thomas Donahue, president of the US Chamber of Commerce.The preliminary agreement announced by the US and Mexico earlier this week included provisions aimed at boosting vehicle production in North America and easing online commerce, among other matters.On Friday, Mexico's Economy Minister Ildefonso Guajardo hailed the US decision to notify Congress as a sign of progress. Mexico will continue to press for Canada to remain in the updated accord, he added.Mr Trump has taken a tough-talking approach to Canada and threatened to levy tariffs on car parts exported from Canada to the US if a deal is not reached.In off-the-record comments made to Bloomberg on Thursday and leaked to the Toronto Star, he boasted that any deal with Canada would be \"totally on our terms\". \"Here's the problem. If I say no - the answer's no,\" he said according to the report. The president later acknowledged the remarks in a tweet, saying: \"At least Canada knows where I stand!\"Wow, I made OFF THE RECORD COMMENTS to Bloomberg concerning Canada, and this powerful understanding was BLATANTLY VIOLATED. Oh well, just more dishonest reporting. I am used to it. At least Canada knows where I stand!End of Twitter post  by @realDonaldTrumpMr Trump has also frequently expressed his distaste for multilateral trade agreements, especially Nafta.In a 2016 presidential debate with Democratic rival Hillary Clinton, he described Nafta as \"the worst trade deal maybe ever signed anywhere\" and a \"killer\" of US jobs.Once in office he said he wanted to renegotiate - not scrap - the accord, triggering the last year of talks.The US has been embroiled in a tit-for-tat trade battle on several fronts in recent months.It has imposed tariffs on steel and aluminium, including from Mexico, Canada and the European Union.It is also engaged in a tit-for-tat trade war with China, as the world's two largest economies wrangle for global influence and place tariffs on each others' goods.A third round of US tariffs on $200bn (£154bn) of Chinese goods could come as soon as next week, according to a Bloomberg report. Asked to confirm this during the Bloomberg interview, President Trump said that it was \"not totally wrong\".Mr Trump has also threatened to place tariffs on imports of cars and vehicle parts, prompting a stand-off with the European Union.",

            "title": "New Mexico compound gang arrested by FBI",
            "content": "Five adults at a desert compound in New Mexico have been arrested by the FBI weeks after a judge received death threats for granting them bail. The two men and three women, residents at a site where 11 starving children and the buried remains of a toddler were found, face conspiracy charges.Child abuse charges against the five were dismissed after a 10-day limit for a hearing was missed by prosecutors.They will now remain in custody pending a hearing in federal court on Tuesday.The charges include unlawful possession of firearms by an illegal immigrant, which carries a maximum sentence of 10 years in prison, and aiding and abetting in the committing of an offence, the FBI said in a statement on Friday. The accused had been under FBI drone surveillance at their remote compound north of Taos since May, according to Taos County Sheriff Jerry Hogrefe.Police raided the compound near Amalia in early August in the search for a missing three-year-old boy, Abdul-Ghani Wahhaj.It was then that they discovered the remains of a young boy along with 11 malnourished children, who were reportedly being held at the site. Police also seized \"at least 11 firearms and a large quantity of ammunition\".The boy's father, Siraj Wahhaj, is suspected of abducting him from his Georgia home in December and was one of the five arrested. He was detained at the site, along with Lucas Morten, Jany Leveille, Hujhrah Wahhaj and Subhannah Wahhaj.On 13 August, Judge Sarah Backus granted bail to the five defendants after she said the prosecution had failed to convince her that they were a threat to the community.The prosecution argued that all five adults were dangerous and claimed they had trained the children to use weapons and prepare to carry out school shootings.\"The state alleges that there was a big plan afoot, but the state hasn't shown to my satisfaction, in clear and convincing evidence, what that plan was,\" Judge Backus said. She ordered that all five must wear ankle monitors and have weekly contact with their lawyers.But her decision was met with protests including an email in which she was called an \"Islamic terror sympathiser\".The Taos County court building was evacuated briefly on Tuesday after the threats.Prosecutors also said that the remains found at the site were those of Abdul-Ghani and that the other children said the boy had died during a \"religious ritual... intended to cast out demonic spirits\", during which Siraj Wahhaj had put his hand to his son's forehead, and recited verses from the Koran. Abdul-Ghani suffered from seizures, but Mr Wahhaj believed the boy was possessed by the devil and needed to be exorcised, court papers said.However defence lawyers accused the prosecution of treating the five suspects unfairly because they are Muslim - something the prosecutors deny.Defence lawyer Thomas Clark said after the hearing that if the accused were Christian and white then \"nobody would bat an eye over the idea of faith healing\". \"But when black Muslims do it, there seems to be something nefarious, something evil,\" he said.

            "title": "Why confidence in Argentina's economy is dwindling",
            "content": "When a business-friendly conservative was elected president of Argentina in October 2015, hopes were high he would put the South American country's economy on a stable path. Mauricio Macri promised to revive Argentina's economy and achieve \"zero poverty\".  But less than three years later, he has unexpectedly asked for the early release of a loan from the International Monetary Fund (IMF). What has gone wrong?The Argentine peso has lost more than 40% of its value against the US dollar this year and inflation is rampant. Everyday life is getting more expensive for Argentines, as the prices of many goods and services still bear a close relation to the US dollar.The government of President Macri has not been able to lower inflation, which is the highest amongst G20 nations. It is failing to enact the economic reforms it promised the IMF, most of them aimed at curbing public spending and borrowing.And the combination of spiralling inflation and public spending cuts means wages are not keeping pace with prices, making most people poorer.Argentina has been plagued by economic problems for years but the commodities boom of the past decades helped the country repay the money it owed the IMF. It cleared its entire debt to the multilateral organisation in 2007.Argentina's economy began to stabilise under President Néstor Kirchner, who governed from 2003 to 2007, but became more shaky again under his wife and successor in office, Cristina Fernández de Kirchner.Her government, which was in power from 2007 until 2015, raised public spending, nationalised companies and heavily subsidised many items of daily life ranging from utilities to football transmissions on television.Most importantly it controlled the exchange rate, which created all sorts of practical problems, such as giving rise to a black market for dollars and heavily distorting prices.Mr Macri was elected on a promise of ending all distortions and returning Argentina to a market-oriented economy where supply and demand, not the state, would define prices.In his first hours in office he put an end to capital controls and began a global campaign to repair Argentina's reputation with foreign investors. He also promised to bring down inflation, which was hovering around 40% per year, by curbing public spending.Argentina's government insists its problem lies with liquidity (a lack of cash) and not with solvency (its ability to meet its financial obligations). In May, it turned to the IMF for help, arguing that the Washington-based fund was the cheapest source of financing available. The argument went that with a loan from the IMF, Argentina would be able to intervene in currency markets for longer and also pay off bonds coming up for payment.At the time, President Macri said he did not plan to use the $50bn (£37.2bn) loan from the IMF except to boost the country's reserves. But with the peso sliding further and hit by a poor soybean and maize harvest, the economy continued to deteriorate. In June, the economy fell by 6.7%, its worst downturn since 2009.With confidence in Argentina's recovery eroded, President Macri on 29 August unexpectedly asked for the early release of the IMF loan.IMF chief Christine Lagarde said the fund was ready to help Argentina but news of the request for early assistance caused the peso to drop more than 7%, its biggest one-day decline since the currency was floated.Going to the IMF is the most unpopular move a president could make in Argentina, where the organisation is widely loathed and blamed for the 2001 economic collapse.In general, Argentines are not quick to panic, having been through so much economic turmoil in the past. But there are people expressing serious concern, especially those from the older generation which lived through Argentina's 2001 economic crisis when the government defaulted on its debt and the banking system was largely paralysed.The effect on Argentines was devastating with many seeing their hard-won prosperity quickly disappearing.Those who experienced it fear a return of the corralito (ring fence), the Spanish name given to government restrictions imposed in 2001 to prevent a bank run.  Under the corralito's constraints, which lasted for a year, people could not freely withdraw money from their accounts, making life very difficult for ordinary Argentines. ",

            "title": "Letter from Africa: The Ghana quiz show bigger than the World Cup",
            "content": "In our series of letters from African journalists, Ghanaian writer Elizabeth Ohene gets quizzical.We have just had the climax of one of the most exciting competitions. No, it was not the Fifa World Cup, which we have been watching without much passion since our cousins the Nigerians failed to make it out of the group stages. The competition that has gripped the country for weeks was the finals of the National Science and Maths Quiz and the grand finale took place earlier this month.The quiz is open to senior high schools and has been running on national television since 1994. It has a cult following among students, parents and especially old students of the schools who appear to be even more passionate than the current ones. This is an enterprise that was started with the stated aim of promoting science and mathematics in our society and if one were to judge simply from the popularity of the programme, you would be tempted to say that the mission of the originators has been accomplished. But I am beginning to think that it is not the content of the competition that is the source of its popularity but the competition for competition sake. In other words, who won and who lost is more important than what the viewers and listeners might have learnt from the questions. The legend says that the programme was born when someone asked his friends why birds could stand on a live electric wire without getting electrocuted, but human beings could not do so. Luckily for him his friends were scientists and professors and they offered him an explanation. One thing led to another and they decided that it would be a good idea to have a quiz programme on national television to promote science and mathematics. One of them was a professor of biochemistry and she became the quiz mistress. She said she agreed to be quiz mistress to encourage females and young ones to become scientists. Elizabeth Ohene:I must confess I am not sure I know the answer to why birds don't get electrocutedThere have since been only female quiz mistresses and the current one is the third in the series, Quiz Mistress Dr Elsie Kaufmann, head of the biomedical engineering department at the University of Ghana, Legon.So, has the success of the programme led to science and mathematics becoming more popular in our country? And what about the idea of using the programme to entice more young people to become scientists and serving as a role model for female scientists? I have tried my own very unscientific survey on some young people. Almost all of them could tell me which schools had been doing well in the competition, but not one person could remember the questions that had been asked. Since the competition started, more than 450 schools have participated but only 11 schools have won the first prize. Only once has a mixed school come on top and all the other times, the boys schools have been the winners.  The girls schools I notice, make it to the quarters and a few times to the semi-finals but not once has a girls school made it into the finals. And yet the girls schools do very well in the West African School Certificate Exams and feature prominently in the admissions into the medical schools, which would provide proof that they do well in science and mathematics.But it looks like the country as a whole has some serious thinking to do about the state of science and mathematics in our schools and in our society as a whole. The West African Examination Council has just announced the results of this year's West African School Certificate Exam results and they make sad reading. We did not do well in mathematics and science and they are core subjects that the young people are required to get credits in to be able to get any further education.  Then there was the news item that shook the country back in 2015. The story said that Ghana had been ranked last among 76 countries across the world in the biggest ever global school rankings in mathematics and science.This was a ranking said to have been done by the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD). Nobody here took any comfort in the fact that other countries in the lowest ranks were Oman, Morocco, Honduras, South Africa which were ranked 72, 73, 74 and 75 respectively.What should we make of our keenly contested National Science and Mathematics Quiz?  And I must confess I am not sure I know the answer to why birds don't get electrocuted when they stand on live electric wires. And it was this question that gave birth to the quiz in the first place.

            "title": "Nauru refugees: The island where children have given up on life",
            "content": "Suicide attempts and horrifying acts of self-harm are drawing fresh attention to the suffering of refugee children on Nauru, in what is being described as a \"mental health crisis\". The tiny island nation, site of Australia's controversial offshore processing centre, has long been plagued with allegations of human rights abuses. But a series of damning media reports recently has also highlighted a rapidly deteriorating situation for young people.\"We are starting to see suicidal behaviour in children as young as eight and 10 years old,\" says Louise Newman, professor of psychiatry at the University of Melbourne who works with families and children on the island.\"It's absolutely a crisis.\" Australia intercepts all asylum seekers and refugees who try to reach its shores by boat. It insists they will never be able to resettle in Australia, so over the years has sent many to privately run \"processing centres\" it funds on Nauru and in Papua New Guinea. Groups working with families on Nauru paint a brutal picture of life for children on the island. Many have lived most of their life in detention, with no idea of what their future will be. The trauma they have endured, coupled with poor - and often dangerous conditions - contribute to a sense of hopelessness.  Natasha Blucher, detention advocacy manager at the Asylum Seeker Resource Centre (ASRC), was unable to share details of specific cases with the BBC due to privacy and safety concerns. But she said ASRC works with about 15 children who have either made repeated suicide attempts or are regularly self-harming. She also believes the problem has reached crisis point. ASRC, like most advocates and medical professionals, assist families on Nauru remotely as access to the island is heavily restricted. It estimates at least 30 children are suffering from traumatic withdrawal syndrome - also known as resignation syndrome. It's a rare psychiatric condition where sufferers, as a response to severe trauma, effectively withdraw from life. The condition can be life-threatening as victims become unable to eat and drink. \"Around three months ago we were seeing a smattering of this... then over that period it seems to have proliferated,\" Ms Blucher told the BBC. Children ‘attempting suicide’ at Greek refugee campProf Newman, a former advisor to the Australian government on the mental health of asylum seekers, says the outbreak of this very serious condition is particularly concerning. \"In many ways it's not surprising… they are exposed to a lot of trauma there [and] a sense of hopelessness and abandonment. They feel very unsafe\". Another physician assisting with children's cases is GP Barri Phatarfod. Her organisation Doctors 4 Refugees has not been allowed to visit Nauru but receives referrals from advocates for assessment and advice. She says of the 60 cases referred to her organisation, every child has some mental health impairment. \"It's impossible not to,\" she says. \"They witness suicide attempts almost daily as well as sexual harassment and physical and sexual abuse and there is no prospect of release.\" At present most cases involve children from Iran, as well as kids from Iraq, Lebanon and Rohinyga. Dr Phatarfod adds that children as young as three are \"displaying inappropriately sexualised behaviour - behaviour that typically only comes from having this acted upon themselves\". One key proponent of the policy was the country's new prime minister, Scott Morrison, who rose to national prominence as a hardline immigration minister. Mr Morrison was one of the toughest enforcers of the divisive \"Stop the Boats\" policy and years later, becomes leader as unease over the treatment of asylum seekers hasn't abated.  Supporters argue the policy has been highly effective, resulting in a dramatic drop in illegal boat arrivals. The government said a vessel that made land this week was the first boat carrying illegal asylum seekers to reach Australia since 2014. But critics point to the huge physical and mental toll exacted on the people placed in offshore detention facilities. In 2015, the site on Nauru became an \"open centre,\" meaning residents can come and go as they please. But this has done little to improve life for children on the island. The tiny Pacific island is just 21 sq km (8 sq miles) and covered with phosphate rocks. It was mined heavily and has few trees or animals. Advocates say even though the camp is technically open, there are few places for people to go. As the children's health crisis worsens, a coalition of human rights groups has demanded the Australian government remove the 119 asylum seeker children off Nauru and resettled them elsewhere. In a statement, the Australian government said it \"takes seriously its role in supporting the Government of Nauru to ensure that children are protected from abuse, neglect or exploitation\". \"A range of care, welfare and support arrangements are in place to provide for the needs of children and young people,\" it said. Medical services including a hospital are available on Nauru but experts say they are inadequate. If a person needs more complex treatment, a referral must be made to the Nauruan government to have them transferred overseas for care. \"When a person cannot receive appropriate treatment for a significant health condition in Nauru, the person is offered treatment in Taiwan, Papua New Guinea or Australia. Those cases are referred to the Department by the person's treating clinician,\" the Australian government said. Still, many argue the system of referrals is failing children on Nauru. Advocates say the process is too slow, and they are overwhelmed by the volume of children experiencing mental health problems. Jennifer Kanis, head of the social justice practice at law firm Maurice Blackburn, is leading several cases to bring urgent medical care to young people on the island. She believes that even though these children have never entered Australian territory, the Australian government has a duty of care. \"It devastating… that we have to take legal action to get proper medical care for these kids,\" Ms Kanis says.   \"The government is more concerned with their policy of keeping this cohort of people seeking asylum off Australia than they are with their health.\" ",

            "title": "Cambodia jails Australian filmmaker found guilty of espionage",
            "content": "An Australian filmmaker has been sentenced by a Cambodian court to six years in prison on charges of spying for an unnamed country.  James Ricketson, 69, was arrested in June 2017 while flying a camera drone over an opposition rally. Ricketson denies the charges and his lawyer said he would appeal against the verdict.His arrest comes amid a wider crackdown on dissent by the increasingly authoritarian government in Phnom Penh.Ricketson has visited Cambodia frequently over the last 20 years and been a firm critic of long-term Prime Minister Hun Sen.Local pro-government media had labelled the filmmaker as a spy acting to promote revolution, but Ricketson expressed only disbelief at the charge.\"Which country was I conducting espionage for?\" he said in court after the verdict was announced, Reuters news agency reports. \"The Phnom Penh Municipal Court has decided to convict James Ricketson and sentences him to six years in prison for espionage and collecting information that is harmful to the nation between December 2010 and June 2017,\" Judge Seng Leang said.During trial, the prosecution argued that Ricketson's work had damaged Cambodia's reputation on the world stage. The prosecution's main argument relied on several emails in which he expressed sympathy for opposition groups. In one email, he urged Australia's government to withdraw an invitation for Hun Sen in 2016. Jonathan Head, BBC South East Asia correspondentThe Cambodian courts make little pretence at being independent from political interference, and many will see this verdict in that light. James Ricketson has been an outspoken critic of the government of Hun Sen. In the past that was not a problem, when Cambodia enjoyed one of the freest media environments in South East Asia  following the UN-supervised peace agreement of the early 1990s. But in recent years Hun Sen has become intolerant of criticism, accused of using the courts to lock up activists, and most recently, the main opposition leader Kem Sokha on a charge of colluding with the US to overthrow the government. Little evidence had been produced to back that charge, or the charge against Ricketson. But both men are still incarcerated, and are likely to remain in jail until they are no longer deemed a threat.  With the main opposition party banned, Hun Sen easily won the most recent general election in July. His increasingly authoritarian rule has been widely condemned by western governments, but Cambodia no longer needs their aid as its economy is dominated by China. The veteran Prime Minister has shown leniency after that election victory, releasing some of his critics. It is possible he will do the same for James Ricketson before the end of his six-year sentence.His family has expressed dismay over the verdict stating: \"James is not a spy. James loves Cambodia and the Cambodian people. He is a filmmaker and a humanitarian\".The filmmaker's lawyer told media that if the verdict is upheld, the Australian government should take diplomatic action. The ruling comes as observers increasingly accuse Cambodia's government of authoritarian rule to suppress dissent. The opposition Cambodia National Rescue Party (CNRP) behind the rally Mr Ricketson was filming has since been banned, leaving the government without any serious political opponent. In this year's general election, Hun Sen's ruling party claimed a landslide victory, but it was a poll that was widely criticised for its failure to allow serious opposition.Hun Sen, a former soldier in the Khmer Rouge who later opposed them, has presided over a sustained period of rapid economic growth.But he has long been accused of using the courts and security forces to crush dissent and intimidate critics.",

            "content": "A German court has sentenced an Afghan migrant to eight and a half years for killing his 15-year-old ex-girlfriend.Abdul D, as he is identified, admitted to stabbing Mia V to death in December in the south-western town of Kandel.Prosecutors believe he acted out of jealousy and revenge after Mia, a German citizen, broke up with him.The case sparked national outrage, and led to far-right groups holding xenophobic protests as part of their broad anti-migrant campaign. Demonstrations have also gripped the eastern city of Chemnitz, after a 35-year-old man was fatally stabbed and two men from Syria and Iraq were arrested.Mia and Abdul D met at school and dated for several months before she ended the relationship a few weeks before her death, prosecutors said. She was stabbed seven times with a kitchen knife by her ex-boyfriend, believed to be from Afghanistan, outside a shop on 27 December. She and her parents had previously gone to the police about Abdul's harassing and threatening behaviour.Abdul D's lawyer told reporters that he thought the Landau district court's decision was correct and that his client had \"accepted\" the sentence of eight years and six months.The murder trial was held behind closed doors in a juvenile court, where prosecutors sought a maximum term of 10 years.The Afghan said he was 15 at the time of the crime, but an expert medical assessment ordered by prosecutors said that he was more likely to be between 17 and 20 years old. He arrived in Germany in April 2016 as an unaccompanied minor and had his request for asylum rejected in February 2017. At the time of the crime, he was living in a supervised group in the town of Neustadt and attending school in Kandel.The case is among a number of high-profile crimes said to involve asylum seekers which have stoked anger against migrants and put pressure on Chancellor Angela Merkel over her liberal refugee policy.Regular demonstrations have been held in Kandel, home to 9,000 people, by the far-right Alternative for Germany (AfD) in an attempt to bolster its anti-migrant campaign.On the other side of the country - in Chemnitz - thousands of people have taken to the streets to protest, after a German-Cuban man was stabbed to death there on 26 August.",

            "title": "Letter from Africa: Did Mugabe's support backfire?",
            "content": "In our series of letters from Africa, journalist-turned-barrister Brian Hungwe looks at Zimbabwe's election fallout.The maxim that there are no permanent friends in politics has never been truer than in Zimbabwe, where historic elections took place last week.The polls were the first without Robert Mugabe - the man who has dominated politics since the country gained independence in 1980 and who at the age of 93 was unceremoniously ousted from power in November.His downfall was partly because of his attempt to foist his wife, Grace Mugabe, to higher office through Zanu-PF, which one faction of the ruling party - and some army generals - could not stomach. \"It was never imaginable, not for a single day, that I would live to see Mr Mugabe voting for the MDC\"His expulsion from power and party led Mr Mugabe to have an ideological change of heart.The day before last Monday's election, he urged people to abandon the \"undemocratic\" Zanu-PF, the party he helped set up 55 years ago, and to back the opposition Movement of Democratic Change (MDC) Alliance.It was never imaginable, not for a single day, that I would live to see Mr Mugabe voting for the MDC.In office, he consistently attacked the MDC as a puppet of the West, saying it was created to reverse the revolutionary gains of our independence and preserve the interests of white people on the commercial farms that he had grabbed in violent seizures.At many of his campaign rallies in the last decade and half, he branded whoever crossed the floor as a shameful sell-out.But what struck me most as Mr Mugabe slouched in his chair at his upmarket residence in the capital, Harare, addressing the world's media, was his use of the word \"undemocratic\".His regime's brutal crackdown on the opposition has been well documented - with photos to show how opponents were dealt with.One of those who suffered was current MDC Alliance leader Nelson Chamisa.He was on his way to a European Union meeting in Brussels in March 2007 when he was beaten up by state agents and left for dead at the airport.Eight days before this, then MDC leader, Morgan Tsvangirai, and 50 senior party leaders had been barred from attending a prayer rally. They too had been beaten, prompting the regional body, the Southern African Development Community (Sadc) to intervene.While lying helplessly on his hospital bed, Mr Chamisa said in an interview that he was paying the price for fighting for democracy.Now the very man who had wanted him dead gave him his vote in the just ended election.If Mr Mugabe had had his way, he would have stood against the 40-year-old Mr Chamisa as, until the military intervention which led to the nonagenarian's removal from power, Zanu-PF had declared him their candidate for the 2018 election.And while Mr Mugabe was endorsing his former enemy, the same white farmers that he reviled were in their hundreds at Borrowdale Race Course in Harare embracing his successor Emmerson Mnangagwa, a Zanu-PF stalwart who was once Mr Mugabe's right-hand man.It was another illustration of how dramatically the political landscape has changed.It would have been understandable for those former white farmers to stick with the MDC. But they now see their political interests safer with Mr Mnangagwa, who has promised 99-year leases to those who want to return to farming.As the election dust settles - with the victory of Mr Mnangagwa being challenged by the MDC Alliance - Mr Mugabe's decision to give his vote to Mr Chamisa is now a source of debate.Did it add or subtract to Mr Chamisa's political fortunes?There has even been speculation that Mr Mugabe funded the opposition - something that has led to divisions within the MDC Alliance.Mr Chamisa has shrugged off such criticism, saying after the election that one vote did not make Mr Mugabe an ally.\"Don't victimise Mr Mugabe for voting for a candidate of his choice, it is his right as a citizen. I thank him if he voted for me,\" he added.The MDC Alliance leader alleges that Zanu-PF rigging lost him the presidential election - by inflating numbers in some areas, something the ruling party denies.However, top MDC official Douglas Mwonzora believes it was Mr Mugabe who cost the party votes in an election some say was the most fair since 1980.\"My opposition to Mugabe is known in the party. I did not like Mugabe. I have opposed working with him. I think Mugabe is a kiss of death,\" he told the state-run Herald newspaper.Whatever Mr Mugabe's true relationship with the MDC Alliance is, electoral expert Tarisai Mutangi says his comments on the day before the polls, when campaigning was barred, cannot be ignored.\"He was a lonely significant voice of the day. It would certainly have had an impact on the election.\"Now Mr Mugabe may even be regretting his choice as he is still without friends in the corridors of powers.He revealed that he has yet to receive a pension worth $467,000 (£367,000) from the government and that his mansion in Borrowdale Brooke is leaking and needs renovations.As a voter I have learnt one thing from this election - never trust a politician. They have few, if any, principles.Follow us on Twitter @BBCAfrica, on Facebook at BBC Africa or on Instagram at bbcafrica",

            "title": "May in Africa: UK prime minister's mission to woo continent after Brexit",
            "content": "The UK's historical relationship with many African countries still counts for something, but, as Prime Minister Theresa May will find on her trip to the continent, the UK now vies for attention with larger economies offering greater riches.Mrs May is travelling to South Africa, Nigeria and Kenya this week on her first African visit as prime minister as she looks to boost Britain's post-Brexit trade.Britain's aim after leaving the European Union in March next year is to \"deepen and strengthen its global partnerships\", Mrs May said in a statement. \"This week I am looking forward to discussing how we can do that alongside Africa to help deliver important investment and jobs as well as continue to work together to maintain stability and security.\"But it might be a hard sell.The UK is introducing legislation that should mean that African businesses will access the UK market on the same terms as they do now.Nevertheless, African countries, many of them former British colonies, will need to redefine their relationship with Britain in the wake of Brexit. The continent's leaders need to decide who to prioritise: an ambitious but friendly China, the huge European Union bloc, the potential riches of the United States, or the historically-linked United Kingdom. In 2015, total trade (imports and exports combined) between Africa and the UK amounted to $36bn (£28bn), but that figure for the EU as a whole was $305bn. In the same year, trade between China and Africa totalled $188bn, and between the US and Africa is amounted to $53bn.To sweeten her offer, the prime minister is bringing along a delegation of 29 business leaders to promote \"the breadth and depth of British expertise in technology, infrastructure, and financial and professional services,\" Downing Street says.Mrs May begins her trip to Africa in her country's largest trading partner on the continent, South Africa, where she will sit down with President Cyril Ramaphosa. She will use a speech in Cape Town on Tuesday to lay out her plans to partner with Africa using private sector trade and investment after the United Kingdom leaves the EU.\"The UK has long been an important trading partner for South Africa and certainly in the current economic climate, where many South African businesses are struggling, numerous entrepreneurs are looking to the UK to expand their reach,\" Rachel Irvine, who runs a public relations and marketing agency, told the BBC. She has recently expanded her business, Irvine Partners, in London and sees significant potential in the prime minister's visit. But she says that it is ultimately about which country offers the best deals.'We welcome both Mrs May and the Chinese, and like any other developing economy we'll do the business that suits us best.\"The prime minister's trip comes a week before the huge Forum on China-Africa Cooperation in Beijing. Dozens of African heads of state are expected there and China may offer new trade and finance deals.The summit comes after Chinese President Xi Jinping's second tour of Africa when he visited Senegal, Rwanda, Mauritius and South Africa. Mrs May's trip seems rather low key in comparison.The British prime minister is also set to meet Nigerian President Muhammadu Buhari in Abuja, just four months after they held talks in London. Nigeria is Britain's second largest trading partner in Africa, but should the country be so focused on the UK?Tunji Andrews, an economist based in Nigeria's commercial hub Lagos, believes Nigeria should concentrate more on its relationship with the European Union. \"The diversity of demand of the EU market makes it slightly more attractive.\"I think it's impossible not to look at the British market at this point, but I'll also say that while Britain remains a viable trade partner, it just doesn't hold the same value to Africa as China and to a lesser extent, the US.\"Nigeria's top export to the UK is crude oil and its largest import is refined oil, a structural inefficiency that leads to regular fuel shortages as the populous West African nation lacks a properly functioning refinery. Mrs May concludes her maiden African trip in Kenya, becoming the first British prime minister to visit the East African country in over 30 years.The country re-exports some of its products to the EU through the UK and there are concerns that a hard Brexit might jeopardise that. Kenya's trade split between the UK and the rest of the EU \"is almost 50-50 and the country will have to strike a good deal with both the UK and the EU because it depends on both markets to sell its tea, fresh produce and other agricultural products,\" says economist Tony Watima. Kenya supplies more roses to the European Union than any other country and is the world's third largest exporter of cut flowers. The country sends 17% of its flowers sold in the EU to the UK. With 500,000 people supported by the flower industry, according to the Kenya Flower Council, every market is critical.But with direct flights from Nairobi to New York beginning in October, the country may be looking to tap into the larger US market for its goods. President Uhuru Kenyatta will meet Mrs May in Nairobi on Thursday just three days after discussing trade with US President Donald Trump at the White House.  Overall, there is a sense that Africa is being wooed from many sides.Mrs May's trip to the continent is part of her mission to create a \"truly Global Britain\". She goes with the hope of offering a new partnership in which both the UK and Africa can benefit, but there are those who want the continent to drive a hard bargain.\"Markets are global, why should Africa have to pick just one?\" asks South African businesswoman Rachel Irvine. \"It is therefore decidedly in the interest of both parties to play nice with each other.\"",

            "title": "Reuters journalists jailed in Myanmar over secrets act",
            "content": "A court in Myanmar has sentenced two Reuters journalists to seven years in prison for violating a state secrets act while investigating violence against the Rohingya minority. Wa Lone and Kyaw Soe Oo, nationals of Myanmar, were arrested while carrying official documents which had just been given to them by police officers.They have maintained their innocence, saying they were set up by police. The case has been widely seen as a test of press freedom in Myanmar.\"I have no fear,\" Wa Lone said after the verdict. \"I have not done anything wrong. I believe in justice, democracy and freedom.\"The two men, who both have families with young children, have been in prison since their arrest in December 2017. Wa Lone, 32, and Kyaw Soe Oo, 28, are Myanmar citizens who were working for the international news agency.They had been collecting evidence about the murders of 10 Rohingya men by the army in the village of Inn Din in northern Rakhine in September 2017. They were arrested before the report's publication, after being handed some documents by two policemen who they met at the restaurant for the first time. A police witness testified during the trial that the restaurant meeting was a set-up to entrap the journalists.The final report - a collaboration with other colleagues - was considered extraordinary, because it gathered testimonies from a range of participants, including Buddhist villagers who confessed to killing Rohingya Muslims and torching their homes. Accounts from paramilitary police also directly implicated the military. The military had previously released its own investigation into allegations of abuse in Rakhine, and exonerated itself of all wrongdoing. Authorities later launched their own probe into the Inn Din killings, confirming the massacre took place and promising to take action against those who had taken part.At least 700,000 Rohingya have fled violence in the country in the past year. The crisis erupted when a brutal crackdown was launched in response to a Rohingya militant group attacking several police posts. The United Nations has called the army's response - including murder, torture, rape, sexual slavery, persecution and enslavement - \"grossly disproportionate to actual security threats\". A UN report - released last week - called for military leaders to face genocide charges for their actions. Myanmar rejected the report. It sees the Rohingya - who have their own culture and language - as illegal immigrants from Bangladesh.Judge Ye Lwin told the court in Yangon the pair had \"intended to harm the interests of the state\".  \"And so they have been found guilty under the state secrets act,\" he said.The verdict had been delayed once because of the judge's ill health.Nick Beake, BBC Myanmar correspondent, YangonWa Lone and Kyaw Soe Oo bowed their heads as the verdict was delivered, while their families broke down in tears in court. The reporters have always insisted they were framed. Wa Lone - who missed the birth of his first child while being detained - protested his innocence once again as he was led away. Many will see this verdict as a crushing blow to freedom of the press in Myanmar and another setback for democracy, three years after Aung San Suu Kyi's party triumphed in free elections. Last week, UN inspectors called for Myanmar's top generals to stand trial for genocide for the crimes committed against the Rohingya - the very subject these reporters were investigating. \"Today is a sad day for Myanmar, Reuters journalists Wa Lone and Kyaw Soe Oo, and press freedom anywhere,\" Reuters editor-in-chief Stephen Adler said. The verdict has been widely criticised by observers and human rights groups.  \"We are extremely disappointed by this verdict,\" Britain's ambassador to Myanmar, Dan Chugg, said according to Reuters.US ambassador Scot Marciel echoed the same criticism, saying the court's decision was \"deeply troubling for everybody who has struggled so hard here for media freedom\".The UN's resident and humanitarian co-ordinator in Myanmar, Knut Ostby, said the UN had \"consistently called for the release\" of the journalists and that \"a free press is essential for peace, justice and human rights for all. We are disappointed by today's court decision\".A free press is essential for peace, justice and human rights for all. We are disappointed by today’s court decision.

            "title": "India Assam: 'I won't die before I prove my Indian citizenship'",
            "content": "Some 1,000 people have been sent to detention centres in India's north-eastern state of Assam after being declared illegal citizens. BBC Hindi's Nitin Srivastava reports on what life has been like for some of them. Ajit Das, 33, fears he may never recover from the three months he spent in a detention camp in the city of Silchar. He was granted bail a few weeks ago to help his wife care for their four-year-old daughter, who is autistic. During his time in the camp, Mr Das lost his job, his health deteriorated and his wife spent a large portion of their savings to visit him regularly.\"I lost 5kg in three months. The food was awful and often half-cooked,\" he says.Mr Das was sent to the detention camp after he was declared an illegal citizen by a special court set up to identify illegal immigrants from neighbouring Bangladesh. Since 1985, these special courts have heard some 85,000 cases of people suspected of being foreigners by India's border police. They have reached decisions on the cases of at least 1,000 people, who are now in six detention centres across Assam. The government is yet to release information on the status of the remaining cases. Illegal migration from Bangladesh to India's north-east, including Assam, has always been a serious concern. Estimates of illegal foreigners range from four million to 10 million - and they have a sizeable presence in at least 15 of Assam's 33 districts. Most of them are engaged in agriculture.Mr Das says his parents arrived from Bangladesh in the 1960s and they died a few years ago. He says he was born in India but the court classified him as a \"doubtful Indian citizen\", claiming that his documents did not prove it. Although the citizenship of Mr Das's wife has not been questioned, their two children have been found to be illegal citizens. The couple have hired a lawyer to challenge the government's decision but Mr Das says that is costing them a lot of money. Although those who have been declared foreigners can appeal the decision, it will be a lengthy process that could take months or even years. Until they get a final decision on their legal status, Mr Das and his family will have to live in limbo. However it is unclear what will happen to them even if they lose the appeal as India has no official treaty with Bangladesh in relation to cross-border illegal immigration.Earlier this month, the Indian government published a list of Assam's proven citizens, which left out the names of some four million people. This has complicated the situation further as the government is yet to clarify if the two processes overlap in any way. Meanwhile, Mr Das is afraid that his bail might be cancelled at any time, forcing him to return to the camp.  He says the camp was a large but cramped room in a red building that houses a prison. All the detention camps in Assam are located within a prison compound. Mr Das recalls at least 35 people eating and sleeping in the single room that was the Silchar camp. And they all used one toilet which had no locks - they waited for 30 minutes every morning for their turn.  He was woken up each morning at 05:00 (23:30 GMT) by a thunderous shout. He had to be ready within the hour or he would miss the daily cup of tea served with two biscuits. Everyone was then ushered out of the room to spend the day out in the open ground surrounded by 40ft (12m) high brick walls.Lunch comprised of rice, pulses and a vegetable, while dinner was hurriedly served before 17:00. They had to return indoors by 18:00, after which the doors would be locked. Outside the camp, people can be seen queuing through the day to meet family members who were inside the walls. Most of them will meet for just 10 minutes, separated by a row of thick iron rods. Those who can afford it buy themselves some extra time. Mohammed Yunus (his name has been changed on his request) says he has visited his father in the Silchar camp every week since he was sent there a year ago. \"Despite having the right to vote and owning a small piece of land, we are forced to prove our citizenship in court,\" he says. Some people have been declared foreigners due to bureaucratic errors - such as Suchandra Goswami, a part-time music instructor.She received a legal notice in 2011 to prove her citizenship. She says she did not respond since her first name was misspelt. But in 2015, she was arrested. She was in prison for three days before she was able to secure bail. \"Three days in prison for a spelling error was enough to destroy my confidence in everything,\" says Ms Goswami. \"I was sobbing for three nights.\" Ms Goswami says she was placed in a regular prison, not a detention camp. Mr Das, too, says he was first put in a prison cell with people who \"were serving time for murder or rape\" and he was moved to the detention centre only after he complained.  India's Supreme Court recently asked both the federal and state governments to submit reports on living conditions in the camps.\"Some [of those identified as \"doubtful citizens\"] have had to stay with prisoners in a common jail because of space constraints,\" S Lakshmanan, a district official, told BBC Hindi. \"But we are committed to improving living conditions. We provide free medical aid and we are in the process of overcoming staff shortages.\"Chandradhar Das, who claims he is more than 100 years old, could not escape the detention camp either. And he can barely walk without support.But his name made it to the \"doubtful Indian citizen\" category and despite his age, he spent three months in a camp. He says he managed with the help of others in the camp. \"I won't die before I prove my Indian citizenship,\" he says. ",

            "title": "China education: Why some mothers want August C-sections",
            "content": "Chinese media have noticed a trend of pregnant women rushing to have Caesarean sections before the end of August, so that their yet-to-be-born children will be in the academic year ahead of September-born babies.The state-owned China News Service (CNS) has released a video featuring a \"busy scene\" of pregnant women at a hospital in the central city of Wuhan. The video prompted thousands of social media comments about Chinese attitudes towards childbirth.The government wants to promote natural births in line with its relaxed child policy. It fears that women who have a Caesarean for their first baby could have complications if they go on to have more children.It is also well documented in China that parents feel pressured to ensure that their child has the competitive edge and are anxious for their children to begin academic learning as soon as possible.The issue has prompted an online debate about Chinese parents' attitude towards education, with concerns being voiced about the social pressures placed on children to succeed before they are even born.By Sean Coughlan, BBC News education correspondentThe evidence from UK research, and highlighted by reports including from MPs, has consistently been that summer-born children do less well in exams.There have even been calls for summer-born children to be given extra marks to make up for the disadvantage - and some parents have campaigned to hold their summer-born children back so they start school a year later.The most common explanation is that children born in the summer are less physically and mentally developed than many classmates when they start school in the autumn.A child born in late August is almost a year younger than a classmate born in early September.Despite the age difference, they compete in the same exams - and the attainment gap for summer-born children persists right through school, up to the age of 16.Studies have shown that summer-born children are much more likely to be placed in lower-ability groups.Starting school earlier also does not seem to mean getting further ahead. Finland is often mentioned as a world leader in education - but formal education does not start there until the age of seven. But children soon catch up and overtake countries where pupils have been in school several years earlier.Major hospitals in Wuhan have seen a rush of expectant mothers in their obstetrics and gynaecology wards, CNS reported on Wednesday.It said the number of pregnant women visiting local hospitals was 30% higher than would be expected.One doctor, Song Xiaohui, told CNS \"some [mothers] have made appointments on 31 August in case they cannot have a baby before 1 September via vaginal delivery\".CNS said doctors had been advising most of the women to have natural births, saying that premature births might lead to a child having underdeveloped lungs and breathing difficulties in later life.But that hasn't deterred some parents from trying to seek a C-section.One parent-to-be, Mr Wang, told CNS he felt his first child had experienced \"problems with delayed schooling\" as a result of being born in September.\"Because we had already encountered this kind of problem with one child, we thought hard about our second child,\" he said. \"It has more or less affected our way of thinking. Children should be born before September.\" CNS said that despite the efforts by some parents to have babies by C-section, most women at the Wuhan hospital were \"more willing to wait for a natural birth\".Caesareans have long been favoured in China as a more advanced and less painful way of delivering a child but the abolition of the one-child policy in October 2015 has prompted the state to encourage people to have natural births.The National Family Commission warned in 2016 that women who chose Caesareans for their first birth could have complications with later pregnancies.Caesarean procedures carry a slightly higher risk than natural births and can cause a ruptured uterus, or a low-lying placenta, both of which risk causing complications for future pregnancies.Although CNS says that choosing to select the timing of a birth has only become a common phenomenon in recent years, Chinese women have long been selective about when they choose to have children, with certain times being regarded as inauspicious.In 2014, it was widely reported that some women were rushing to have children before 2015 - the year of the sheep. Couples were anxious that if they had sheep babies, they would grow up to be followers, rather than leaders.But striving to have a child before September is a relatively modern phenomenon, with state-run Xinhua News Agency saying that it leaves parents feeling they have \"won time\" regarding their child's education.Some social media users are extremely critical of women trying to have premature births for the reason of academic achievement.Thousands of users of the popular Sina Weibo microblog are discussing the phenomenon, with some saying that a woman's body is her own and that she has the right to choose.But many users say the trend is \"crazy\" and shows the way in which Chinese parents are putting too much pressure on their children.\"Do people nowadays no longer care about the health of a foetus?\" one user asks. \"A full-term birth is more conducive to a baby's health.\"\"This is insane - that society is so eager for quick success,\" another adds.\"A child is not yet born, but he's already being placed on the starting line,\" one user says.\"The system is ridiculous, and these women are ridiculous,\" another adds.Many social media users say they think China's competitive education system is to blame, and some fear the impact on infant health.\"Premature births can have an impact on a child's intelligence,\" one user notes.Another user adds they think the trend is inherently \"Chinese\". \"Our system is not human,\" they say.BBC Monitoring reports and analyses news from TV, radio, web and print media around the world.

            "title": "China congress: How authorities censor your thoughts",
            "content": "If you control public communication you can control the way people think and how they behave. That's what Xi Jinping's government is counting on.And it is never more true than at the time of major political gatherings.The Communist Party Congress, held every five years, is set to begin next week: an event which will culminate in the revelation of the new leadership team behind General Secretary Xi.So the censors here are poised to restrict with one hand and disseminate with the other.What they're looking out for are key words and expressions popping up in social media. Anything signalling an intention to protest or ridiculing the country's senior political figures will be blocked and potentially see a user reported to the authorities.For example, a message featuring the name of this country's ever-more powerful leader and his sometimes-used nickname \"Winnie the Pooh\" (小熊维尼) will simply not go through to group discussions on the messaging app WeChat.Funny stickers featuring Mr Xi or previous Chinese leaders also can't be sent to chat groups.China has all the appearances of an increasingly open society: flashy new cities with Hollywood movies advertised on bus stops; digital currency taken up like nowhere else; cool kids getting around on hire bikes zooming through a gleaming modern existence.And yet, since Mr Xi came to power five years ago, public discourse has been increasingly censored to try and control everything from political thought to sexual activity.In the lead up to the Olympic Games in 2008, it felt as if freedom of expression was ever on the rise here.New laws allowed foreign reporters to travel around the country without specific permission from local governments. It's hard to believe it, but Google searches were not blocked then. Investigative journalism from local Chinese publications - like the Southern Weekend newspaper and Caijing magazine - was becoming as good as anywhere in the world.I remember being at a function where a group of journalists were speaking to one of the foreign affairs ministry spokespeople. We had some concern or other, and he was reassuring us that everything would be all right.\"Don't worry,\" he said, smiling as he pushed an imaginary truck gear into position. \"In China we only have one gear, and it's forward.\"It sometimes doesn't feel like that now.\"You can't control the internet,\" is something people would say in those years - part mantra, part celebration of a new global reality.But Chinese officials have worked out that actually, you can.Rather than connecting to the internet, this country has something more like an intranet within the boundaries of the Great Firewall of China. Sites like Amnesty International, Facebook, and Twitter are unreachable for most Chinese, unless they have use of a virtual private network (VPN), which effectively punts their computer over the Great Firewall.So, with the congress approaching, there's been an assault on VPN use. The government has ordered Apple to remove all VPNs from its Chinese app store.The company has decided in favour of not being kicked out of this enormous market and is doing what Beijing wants.Years ago Google was given a similar ultimatum: allow Chinese officials to censor search results or you're gone. Google didn't cave in, and was blocked.China's most effective censorship tool is also the country's most widespread method of communication.Pretty much everybody here uses the phone app WeChat. It has text messaging, group chats, photo sharing, location searching and electronic payments.During periods of political sensitivity - like now - key words will trigger the blocking or monitoring of a post. If sensitive enough, they could even lead to state security knocking on your door.New regulations also make a person who sets up a group chat responsible for what's said amongst the group.As you can imagine, the administrators of football team chats might be feeling a little nervous about the content of late night posts from drunken players.Some will wonder how this is all possible as the app is not owned by the government but run by the hugely-powerful Chinese company Tencent. Well, under new regulations from the Cyber Administration of China, private entities which run these platforms are required to not only enforce content restrictions but also report those who violate them to the \"relevant authorities\".For many Chinese people - even those overseas - WeChat has also become their main news feed. If you restrict this content you can close out certain news coverage.Potential challengers to WeChat's virtual monopoly are also being reined in. WhatsApp is not 100% within the domain of the Chinese state.So, at times in recent weeks, its use has been impossible to reach without a VPN.It is not clear whether the disruption of WhatsApp is a temporary measure to coincide with the congress or yet another restriction that's here to stay.It is no secret that every Chinese newspaper and television station is under the complete control of the Communist Party.And yet last year, when Mr Xi visited the People's Daily newspaper, Xinhua wire service and state broadcaster CCTV, he still demanded the absolute loyalty of reporters who should follow the Party's leadership in \"politics, thought and action\".But, just in case some journalists didn't get the memo, a set of rules have been sent around governing coverage of this year's congress, requiring all interviews with experts or scholars to be approved by the outlet's \"work unit leadership\" and the central propaganda department.However, China's censorship and propaganda model is also going beyond sensitive political matters. Online bookstores must now work under a rating system from the State Administration of Press, Publication, Radio, Film and Television which includes the promotion of \"moral values\".Popular blogs focusing on celebrity scandals and the intrigues of the rich and famous have been forced to close.To talk about such matters has been deemed to be not in keeping with \"core socialist values\".For a time, cheap online video dramas were pushing out the boundaries of what could be viewed here. There was a gay sitcom, for example. But digital platforms have been ordered to stop showing hundreds of foreign shows, and their locally produced material is expected to follow the same restrictions as television.As it is, on Chinese TV you rarely see anything approaching a passionate kiss. Two years ago a TV drama was forced to reframe and zoom in on its shots so as to crop out the generous cleavage of its 7th Century maidens, in order to remain on air.Thus goes the creeping imposition of a state-sanctioned morality under Mr Xi's administration.Last month, TV dramas were given notice of a new set of rules governing their content. They should \"enhance people's cultural taste\" and \"strengthen spiritual civilisation\". Directors are supposed to come up with engaging characters beyond the realms of lewd behaviour, extra-marital affairs, gambling, drugs, homosexuality and other forms of \"immoral\" behaviour.The notice suggested eulogising the Communist Party of China, the country, the people and also national heroes. And one figure is emerging via the propaganda machine to stand head and shoulders above all others.As the censors shut down dissent, the party is urging a way of thinking about all that's good in China and tracing it back to a single source - Xi Jinping.An exhibition focusing on the recent achievements of the Chinese government has opened in Beijing.Vast rooms are dedicated to science, transport, the military, the economy, sport, ethnic minorities, and they are all dominated by massive photos of Xi Jinping. There must be hundreds of them.The English language newspaper China Daily has been rolling out a series of front page stories - one every day - about the \"impact of\" a visit from Mr Xi on various villages, towns and cities after the General Secretary passed on his advice.\"He asked people to protect the lake\", \"President Xi proposed moving people in the villages to the new settlement\", \"Xi emphasised the importance of afforestation\", et cetera.Some here are joking that this type of reporting is not all that far from what you might expect in the North Korean press describing its own god-like leaders.When Chinese officials make speeches now, they refer to this or that aspect of what they're up to \"with Xi Jinping at the core\".It goes without saying that you cannot question \"the core\" without this nation's considerable censorship apparatus crashing down upon you.But, short of such an obvious breach, the rules regarding what can and can't be said, broadcast, forwarded, analysed are thought to be kept deliberately vague. In this way, everyone is on their toes and the authorities can shut down what they like at any time without having to give a reason.Editors, cartoonists, reporters, directors, bloggers, comedians, administrators running social media platforms and ordinary Chinese citizens posting to their friends are all staying well clear of certain subjects just in case it lands them in hot water.In short: Chinese censorship works, and plenty of other governments around the world are looking on with admiration.",

            "title": "Sandy Hook families v Alex Jones: Defamation case explained",
            "content": "The parents of a 2012 mass shooting victim can sue Infowars host and conspiracy theorist Alex Jones for defamation, a Texas judge has ruled. Mr Jones sought to dismiss the suit brought by the parents of a boy killed in the Sandy Hook school massacre. Leonard Pozner and Veronique De La Rosa allege they were harassed and forced to move after Mr Jones decried the attack that left 26 dead as a left-wing hoax.The case is one of five defamation lawsuits he is facing. Mr Jones argued that he was protected from the lawsuit by his first amendment free speech rights under the US constitution. He also sought more than $100,000 (£77,000) in court costs from the couple. But Judge Scott Jenkins of Travis County, Texas rejected Mr Jones' argument and his motion to dismiss the lawsuit, according to court papers.  Alex Jones is the founder and host of Infowars - a far-right radio and online show that is best known as a platform for Mr Jones' conspiracy theories.After the Sandy Hook Elementary School shooting that left 20 young children and six adults dead in 2012, he repeatedly described the incident as a hoax on his show.He alleged the massacre was \"completely fake\", using actors and staged by the government in order to promote its agenda for nationwide gun control. Mr Jones has faced criticism before for similar claims, including his claim that the 9/11 attacks were also staged by the government.Infowars touts millions of listeners and viewers. Mr Jones has also interviewed President Donald Trump, who has repeated Infowars claims on his Twitter feed and in speeches.More than five years after Sandy Hook, the parents of Noah Pozner - who was six years old when he was shot and killed - are suing Mr Jones for defamation. Mr Pozner and Ms De La Rosa are suing Mr Jones in Travis County, where Mr Jones is based.Last April, Mr Jones posted a video titled \"Sandy Hook Vampires Exposed\", which implied Ms De La Rosa was an actor. This video is at the centre of the parents' case, as defamation claims in certain states have a one-year statute of limitations.The family's legal action also followed an incident in which a Florida woman who believed Mr Jones' claims began making death threats against Mr Pozner.Mark Bankston, the lawyer for the Pozner family, says his clients are suing Mr Jones because they believe he has no intention of leaving them alone.The judge has yet to rule on a second defamation case against Mr Jones, brought by Neil Heslin, the father of slain Sandy Hook student Jesse Lewis.Mr Heslin's complaint alleges that Mr Jones accused him of lying about holding his son's body with a bullet hole in his head.On Infowars, Mr Jones has said the defamation case is \"all out of context\".His defence argues first and second amendment rights as they ask for the lawsuit to be thrown out. The first amendment in the US constitution guarantees free speech; the second affords the right to bear arms.The media mogul's defence team claims that it is his constitutional right to invent stories and that no reasonable person would take Mr Jones' words as fact.Mr Jones has also implied that the parents are actors seeking to undermine laws allowing private gun ownership.His lawyer Mark Enoch claims the lawsuit is attacking the second amendment by targeting Mr Jones' free speech rights, according to the Austin-American Statesman newspaper.He said the lawsuit was part of the parents' public campaign \"to outlaw conspiracy theories, assault rifles, high-capacity clips and to increase firearm registration requirements\".As a part of his argument, Mr Enoch also says that the Pozners are operating as public figures, just as Mr Jones is, which means to prove defamation, they must also prove \"actual malice\".To win, a plaintiff must prove that the defendant made a false statement of fact about them and that they suffered harm as a result.In addition, most states have a statute of limitations of one to three years for bringing any defamation cases.If the plaintiff is a public figure - a film star or politician - they must prove that the person making the false statement acted intentionally or with reckless disregard for the truth, known as \"actual malice\".\"What makes things trickier, however, is that the law has a concept of a 'limited-purpose public figure,'\" litigator Devon Holstad told the BBC. \"This definition is hard to describe, but it pertains to people who are ordinary citizens but may be well known because of a specific issue or within a certain following of people.\"This is one of the arguments that Alex Jones is making - that the parents are public figures because they speak publicly on issues such as gun violence,\" Mr Holstad says.Texas-based media lawyer Marc Fuller told the BBC that if the parents do have to prove actual malice, it can be difficult to win.\"Showing that a defendant either knowingly lied or was reckless about the truth of his or her statement is a high standard, particularly in cases involving mainstream news reporting,\" Mr Fuller says. \"In addition, the first amendment protects opinion and rhetorical hyperbole, both of which are commonly at issue where the alleged defamation was published in social media or non-traditional media.\"In an era of fake news and social media, this suit may have an impact on future free speech claims, especially those concerning social media figures.\"Alex Jones is obviously an extreme case, but I do think that we are seeing an increase in politically-charged defamation cases,\" Mr Fuller told the BBC.\"These types of cases will continue to present interesting issues relating to the consequences of participating in public debate and how to draw the line between fact and opinion in those debates.\"This case has already had an impact on various social platforms. Apple, YouTube, Facebook and Spotify all deleted Infowars content in recent weeks, citing hate speech.Earlier this month, Twitter banned Mr Jones for a week, but has come under fire for refusing to close his account.But technology companies continue to grapple with regulation and free speech in social media-driven cases. \"One thing social media has done is give more people the ability to make statements to a broader audience,\" Mr Holstad says. \"This will be one area of important development for first amendment law in the years to come.\"",

            "title": "Russia's Putin softens pension reforms after outcry",
            "content": "Russian leader Vladimir Putin has softened planned pension changes following angry protests and a slump in his approval rating.He said the retirement age for women would be increased from 55 to 60 instead of to 63. But a five-year increase for men, to 65, would stay. In a rare TV address, Mr Putin said the country's working-age population was shrinking, making change essential.Unions have warned that many will not live long enough to claim a pension.Russian men have a life expectancy of 66 while for women it is 77, the World Health Organization says.The issue has seen support for Mr Putin fall to 64% from 80%, according to VTsIOM state pollster. Mr Putin said the move to raise the retirement age for men and women had been delayed for years and risked causing inflation and increasing poverty.Postponing it further would threaten the stability and security of Russian society, he said.\"Any further delay would be irresponsible,\" he said.\"Our decisions should be just and well-balanced,\" he added.Until his TV address he had attempted to distance himself from the row, and had in the past promised that the pension age would never be raised on his watch.Under the new plan, to be implemented from 2019, the retirement age for men will be increased gradually from 60 to 65.Before Mr Putin's intervention women were to have to work another eight years from 55 to 63 - their planned retirement age has now been reduced to 60.Mr Putin said that Russia \"cherished women\".\"Women not only work but they also take care of the house and children and grandchildren. Their retirement age should not increase by more than that of men,\" he said.Women with three or more children could retire earlier, he added.Prime Minister Dmitry Medvedev has previously said the decision was motivated by the fact that Russians are living longer and leading more active lives.He said there were 12 million working pensioners in Russia, equal to nearly a quarter of all pensioners.Tens of thousands have rallied across Russia in recent weeks.\"Help the state, die before your pension,\" read one home-made placard in the Siberian city of Omsk in early July, where about 3,000 people turned out. \"The government must go,\" read another.This activist posted photos from a protest in Komsomolsk-on-Amur in Russia's far-eastern region in early July.Unusually for Russia, protesters have been from all sides of the political debate.Communist Party red flags and nationalist banners flew side by side, and opposition supporters joined in too.The initial announcement was made at the same time as the World Cup in Russia began, prompting criticism that the Russian government was trying to bury bad news.Most economists and many Russians agree there is a problem. The population is getting older and the state is spending more and more on pensions.After the economic chaos of the early 1990s, Russia's population plummeted. The birth rate has since shown some signs of improvement, but it is not happening fast enough.Based on current trends, 20% of Russians will be over 65 by 2050, says the UN.President Putin has just signed a new bill on pension spending, envisaging a deficit of more than 265bn roubles (£3.1bn; $4.2bn) in 2018. That's 1.6% of the entire state budget expenditure.It is clearly not a sustainable situation, especially in tough economic times.",

More than 300 people were killed during the recent political unrest.The report released on Wednesday by the UN High Commissioner for Human Rights called on the government to stop the persecution of protestors and disarm masked gangs who it alleges are responsible for killings and arbitrary detentions. It also described the torture and use of excessive force using interviews with victims and local human rights groups.For its part, the government said the report was biased and ignored attacks by protesters on members of the governing Sandinista party. President Ortega had invited the UN team to help monitor a national dialogue process between the government and the protestors which stalled.He said earlier this week that the UN had overstepped its authority and was violating Nicaragua's national sovereignty.",

            "content": "Ex-presidents Barack Obama and George W Bush have paid tribute to Senator John McCain at a memorial service at Washington's National Cathedral.The Vietnam War hero, who became one of America's most high-profile politicians, died a week ago from brain cancer at the age of 81.His daughter Meghan was the first to speak, paying an emotional tribute to her father while also criticising President Donald Trump's agenda.Mr Trump did not attend the service.The two Republicans had major differences, both personal and political, and Mr McCain's family made it clear that Mr Trump was not welcome.Members of the Trump administration who were present included the president's daughter Ivanka and son-in-law Jared Kushner. Following memorial services in the state of Arizona - which Mr McCain represented as a senator, and where he died last Saturday - and in Washington, a private burial service will be held at the US Naval Academy in Annapolis, Maryland, on Sunday.On Friday Mr McCain's body was taken back to the Congress buildings where he worked for decades and lay in state in the Capitol rotunda overnight.On the way from the Capitol to the cathedral on Saturday morning, the cortege stopped at the Vietnam Veterans Memorial, where his widow Cindy laid a wreath.Meghan McCain told mourners at the cathedral: \"We gather here to mourn the passing of American greatness.\"The real thing, not cheap rhetoric from men who will never come near the sacrifice he gave so willingly, nor the opportunistic appropriation of those who live lives of comfort and privilege while he suffered and served.\"The America of John McCain is generous and welcoming and bold, she is resourceful and confident and secure, she meets her responsibilities, she speaks quietly because she is strong. \"America does not boast, because she does not need to. The America of John McCain has no need to be made great again, because America was always great.\"Former President Obama paid tribute to the man he defeated in the 2008 US presidential election.He described Mr McCain as an \"extraordinary man - a warrior, a statesman, a patriot\" who embodied much of what made America great.Mr Obama said that, despite their many differences, \"we never doubted we were on the same team\".He added: \"John understood that our security and our influence was won not just by our military might, not just by our wealth, not just by our ability to bend others to our will, but from our capacity to inspire others with our adherence to a set of universal values - like rule of law and human rights - and an insistence on the God-given dignity of every human being.\"Mr Bush - who defeated Mr McCain for the Republican presidential nomination in 2000 - paid tribute to the senator's courage, honesty and sense of honour.\"At various points during his long career, John confronted polices and practices that he believed were unworthy of his country. To the face of those in authority, John McCain would insist: 'We are better than this, America is better than this.'\"John would be the first to tell you he was not a perfect man, but he dedicated his life to national ideals that are as perfect as men and women have as yet conceived.\"Other speakers included former Senator Joe Lieberman and former Secretary of State Henry Kissinger, 95.Before he went into politics, Mr McCain was a US Navy pilot who was shot down over Hanoi while on a bombing mission in 1967.He was held as a prisoner until 1973, enduring torture that - along with the injuries he sustained bailing out of his jet - left him with life-long injuries.While deeply conservative on some issues, the Arizona senator had a maverick streak that endeared him to political friends and opponents.He championed reform of US immigration, campaign finance and environmental laws, and was outspoken in criticising those who advocated what he considered torture against captured enemies of the US.The pallbearers he chose reflected his desire to reach across political divides. They included Hollywood actor and liberal political activist Warren Beatty; former independent New York City Mayor Michael Bloomberg; liberal former Senator Russ Feingold, who drew up campaign finance reform legislation with McCain; and Russian opposition politician Vladimir Kara Murza.",

            "title": "Obituary: Rosa Bouglione, the undisputed queen of the circus",
            "content": "When Rosa Bouglione was married inside a lion's cage, the pastor, despite his best efforts, was made to stay outside. It wouldn't have been much of a wedding had he been mauled.It was only appropriate that this was where Rosa had chosen to be married. After all, she had started her career inside a lion's cage, working as a serpentine dancer, in her mid-teens.This was the circus life into which she was born, in the back of a horse-drawn caravan in Belgium in December 1910. Her father was an animal trainer with the family outfit, Ménagerie Van Been, and they toured Europe alongside their snakes, bears and lions.\"I was born in a caravan, and that's where I left my heart,\" Rosa would later write in her autobiography. Aged 17, however, there was another contender for her heart: she fell for a man from another circus family, Joseph Bouglione, whom she said reminded her of a cowboy, and the two were married among the lions.Their honeymoon was as unusual as their wedding - they spent it working with the troupe of the Wild West Show, established by hunter and showman Buffalo Bill Cody.Rosa's life after joining the Bouglione family brought her close to France's high society and made her a household name, even if attitudes towards the circus began to change in her later years.Rosa Bouglione died in Paris on Sunday, 26 August aged 107.Her funeral on Wednesday took place in the ring of the Cirque d'Hiver (Winter Circus), the 1,500-person venue in the Marais district which she and her husband's family took over in 1934.The grand circular building, commissioned by Napoleon III, remained the Bouglione family's base, even as they, their animals, clowns and performers travelled the world. It was a life that Joseph Bouglione said was like a constant holiday.In an interview in 2011, Rosa recalled one trip to Brazil, on which they were accompanied by 30 horses, 10 lions, six tigers and a polar bear, among other animals.When the captain of the ship carrying them tried to throw the circus' elephants overboard to reduce the ship's weight during a storm, Joseph threatened to organise a mutiny and so the crew tossed away much of the cargo instead.Running the circus was a feat of logistics: 100 trucks full of animals and equipment would have to be unloaded and then reloaded in a day, and 40 tonnes of cloth packed up tidily at the end of each show.And then there was the small matter of managing the animals themselves. There was Jacky the gorilla, who would drink only Perrier water and would make hammocks out of the curtains of any hotels where the troupe stayed.There was the anaconda which would squeeze the most attractive women a little tighter than the others. There was Coco, the foul-mouthed parrot who would fly to the balcony and scream \"Help!\" so loudly the police would come rushing round.Even as one of the biggest names in the circus world, the family was not always welcome on its travels, as Rosa told France's TF1 network in 2011. They were gypsies by origin, and were often treated with suspicion and subject to allegations as they arrived in a new town.\"I never understood it,\" she said. \"People said we'd steal children. But we never did. We had our own children, we didn't need to steal children. But we just let them say this stuff.\"It was the Cirque d'Hiver that provided the platform for some of the family's biggest shows and most notable successes. Among them was La Perle du Bengale, where one performer braved the full force of a whip strike, and damsels in distress fell into pools swarming with snakes.Rosa stopped performing and did more work behind the scenes of the circus, and over time, the venue attracted the biggest names from the entertainment world and regularly hosted live TV specials.The actress, singer and black icon Josephine Baker was one, and soprano Maria Callas another. When Callas once got a little too close to Joseph Bouglione, she was almost crushed by an elephant that was wary of women other than Rosa being around him.Rosa and Joseph eventually brought an end to their life on the road, moving in to a house around the corner from the circus in 1984.Joseph died three years later but Rosa remained there until her death, surrounded by reminders of her career. Among them, the pelt of her pet leopard Mickey, that would sit on top of the dining table, his head still attached, seemingly snarling at any visitors.She would still attend matinees into her old age, and would let the performers know her opinion. \"The shows got bigger and the children got bigger, but I got smaller,\" she said.Entertainment in 2018 is very different to that of the early 20th Century, when Rosa began dancing in the lion's cage.Nowadays, the Cirque d'Hiver is just as well known as a concert venue, or as the setting for political rallies. The industry is also under growing pressure to end the use of live animals - a debate that has arrived in France a little later than in other countries.Before his resignation this week, French environment minister Nicolas Hulot had said he was against the practice, and after the shooting to death of a tiger that had escaped from another Paris circus last November, campaigners renewed their calls for a ban on the use of live animals in shows.In 2016, the Bouglione family announced it would no longer use an ageing elephant in its shows after an environmental group accused the circus of mistreating the animal.But the family is divided about whether animals should still be a part of its performances.Last May, one of Rosa and Joseph's grandsons, André, who founded his own circus, said he would end the practice. \"It's because of my love of animals and out of respect for the public that I stopped this,\" he told the campaign group 30 Millions d'Amis in an interview.\"I saw a survey that said 80% of French people cared about animal rights. Our job is entertaining families. So if a very large majority of families believes this, we can't continue doing something that upsets them.\"But another grandson, Francesco, who is now the director of the Cirque d'Hiver, has vowed to continue using animals and has condemned what he calls \"eco-terrorism\".He told the Journal du Dimanche newspaper last year: \"We're tired of being tainted by false claims, without mentioning the protests in front of our tents and acts of sabotage. This won't end well.\"Rosa Bouglione leaves 55 children, grandchildren, great-grandchildren and great-great grandchildren, and a family name which remains above the entrance to the Cirque d'Hiver.In a statement, her family said she was \"the undisputed queen of the circus world\", adding: \"Her passion for the circus stayed with her until the very end.\"A new show honouring Rosa's life, named Extra, will begin at the Cirque d'Hiver on 6 October.

            "content": "Two Malaysian women convicted of attempting to have lesbian sex in a car have been caned in a religious court.The Muslim women, aged 22 and 32, were each caned six times in the Sharia High Court in the state of Terengganu. According to an official, this is the state's first conviction for same-sex relations and its first public caning.Human rights activists reacted with outrage. Homosexual activity is illegal under both secular and religious laws.The caning was witnessed by more than 100 people, according to local news outlet The Star. Malaysian rights group Women's Aid Organisation told Reuters news agency it was \"appalled by this grave violation of human rights\".A member of the Terengganu state executive council, Satiful Bahri Mamat, defended the punishment, telling the agency it had not been intended to \"torture or injure\" and had been carried out in public to \"serve as a lesson to society\".The duo, whose identities have not been revealed, were arrested in April by Islamic enforcement officers after they were found in a car in a public square in Terengganu. They had last month pleaded guilty to breaking Islamic laws and were sentenced to be caned and fined RM3,300 ($800, £619).\"Sexual acts between two consenting adults should not be criminalised, let alone punished with whipping,\" Women's Aid Organisation said.According to The Star, caning under Islamic law is not similar to caning carried out for crimes under civil law. It is not meant to cause pain.Malaysia is known to be a moderate Muslim-majority country but has seen rising religious sentiment in recent years.Earlier last month, a minister ordered that portraits of LGBT activists be removed from a public exhibition.Malaysia operates a dual-track legal system. Muslims are bound by Sharia - or Islamic - law on personal matters like marriage and custody rights, while members of other faiths follow civil law.",

            "title": "Palestinians fear cost of Trump's refugee agency cut",
            "content": "\"Dignity is priceless,\" read the signs as thousands of employees of the UN agency for Palestinian refugees march through central Gaza City.  They fear Washington's recent decision to withhold $65m (52.5m euros; £46m) - possibly rising to $290m - in funds could affect their positions as well as basic services which most of them, as refugees, rely on. \"Unrwa was there every moment for me,\" says Najwa Sheikh Ahmed, an information officer with the UN Relief and Works Agency.  \"It gave not only food, clothes, education and healthcare but also a job and the opportunity that offers your family.\"  Najwa was born in Khan Younis refugee camp and brought up in tough conditions.She moved to Nuseirat camp when she married her husband, who is also Unrwa staff.  They have five children. When I visit, we pass along narrow streets to the local clinic, painted in the blue and white colours of the UN, so Najwa can get a medical check.  I watch her eldest daughter, Salma, as she excels in an English lesson.  She is one of 270,000 Unrwa students in Gaza.\"As a mother I feel very worried,\" Najwa confides. \"If the funding gap isn't bridged, then Unrwa might find itself in a situation where [it has] to close the schools and health services. My children will be at risk.\"The US is the largest single donor to Unrwa.  Last year, it gave the agency around $360m - about half of the total amount it gave in support to the Palestinians.President Donald Trump first indicated a change in approach on 2 January when he Tweeted that his country got \"no appreciation or respect\" for the large sums of aid it gave.  The State Department insists that freezing Unrwa funds is linked to needed \"reforms\", but suspicions remain that it is meant to punish Palestinian leaders.  They cut ties with the White House weeks earlier after it recognised Jerusalem as Israel's capital.  The Palestinians claim East Jerusalem as the capital of their future state.Last week in Davos, Switzerland, Mr Trump said that aid to the Palestinians would be suspended \"unless they sit down and negotiate peace\".In the impoverished Gaza Strip, which has eight refugee camps, ordinary people complain that they find themselves helplessly caught up in geopolitics.Unrwa was originally set up to take care of hundreds of thousands of Palestinians displaced by the 1948 Arab-Israeli war.  Nearly 70 years on, some of those refugees and many of their descendants continue to live in camps, which are now chronically overcrowded breeze block neighbourhoods.   Unrwa supports some five million people not only in the Palestinian Territories but also in Jordan, Lebanon and Syria - where Palestinian refugees have limited rights. The fate of the refugees is a core issue in the Arab-Israeli conflict and they have often been at the heart of Palestinian political and militant activity.Palestinians call for their \"right to return\" to parts of historic Palestine - land which is now in Israel. Israel rejects that claim and has often criticised the set-up of Unrwa for the way it allows refugee status to be inherited, which it points out is uniquely applied to Palestinians among all the world's refugees.\"How long are we going to have Unrwa? Another 70 years?\" the Prime Minister, Benjamin Netanyahu, said to me at a recent press event.  \"We already have great-great-grandchildren who are refugees - who are not refugees but they're on the list of Unwra.\"Mr Netanyahu suggests donations should be shifted to other humanitarian agencies, including the UN High Commission for Refugees.\"It will have positive effects because the perpetuation of the dream of bringing the descendants back to Jaffa is what sustains this conflict,\" he told me.  \"Unrwa is part of the problem not part of the solution.\"  Unrwa officials stress that the UN General Assembly sets their mandate and dismiss the idea it obstructs any Israel-Palestinian peace deal. \"It is the failure of the political parties to resolve the refugee issue that perpetuates it,\" says Unrwa spokesman Chris Gunness.  \"As soon as there's a resolution of that based on international law, based on United Nations resolutions, Unrwa will go out of business and hand over its service.\"  The agency has now launched a global appeal to fill the gap in its budget and is receiving many messages of support - including from celebrities and 21 international humanitarian groups.Some in Israel also raise concerns that weakening Unrwa could cause regional instability and create more extremism.  \"While Unrwa is far from perfect, the Israeli defence establishment and the Israeli government as a whole, have over the years come to the understanding that all the alternatives are worse for Israel,\" a former Israel Defense Forces (IDF) spokesman, Peter Lerner, wrote in Haaretz newspaper.  At the rally in Gaza City, participants focus on the impact of any Unrwa cutbacks on the most needy but also on existential issues.\"Without Unrwa nobody will identify us as refugees,\" says Najwa Sheikh-Ahmed - whose father fled from his home in al-Majdal - now in Ashkelon in southern Israel - as a boy in 1948.  \"My refugee number, my ration card is witness to the fact that once upon a time I had a homeland,\" she says.  \"Without this we will lose the right to fight for our rights.\"",

            "title": "Viewpoint: Why Trump's threats to Pakistan raise serious questions",
            "content": "On Monday night, President Donald Trump unveiled the long awaited results of his policy review of the Afghanistan war. He announced that US troops would remain in the country without a timetable for withdrawal, with other reports suggesting that 4,000 further troops would be added. This would boost present numbers by around a third, although it would leave the American presence far short of its peak of 100,000 in 2010-11.  But Mr Trump's speech also included two important new elements. He launched a blistering attack on Pakistan, publicly articulating what his predecessors only said in private. \"We have been paying Pakistan billions and billions of dollars at the same time they are housing the very terrorists that we are fighting,\" declared the president. \"It is time for Pakistan to demonstrate its commitment to civilisation, order, and to peace\". This was followed by more threats from Secretary of State Rex Tillerson and the National Security Council spokesman. And if this were not bad enough for Pakistan, Mr Trump then applauded India's \"important contributions to stability in Afghanistan\", urging New Delhi to play a larger role. Since the beginning of the war, Pakistan has allowed the use of its territory to supply international troops in landlocked Afghanistan, tacitly accepted American drones over its airspace, and co-operated with Western intelligence agencies against some terrorist groups like Al Qaeda. However, Pakistan's intelligence agency, the ISI, has also given shelter and support to Afghan insurgents from the 1970s to the present, including the especially virulent Haqqani network. Its aim has been to limit India's influence - but is also influenced by its disagreements with Kabul. Ever since partition, Afghan governments of all stripes have rejected the border known as the Durand Line, laying claim to some Pashtun areas inside Pakistan.  There are three big questions around Trump's approach to Pakistan. The first is whether his words will translate into action. After all, we've been here before. \"We need to make clear to people that the cancer is in Pakistan\", President Barack Obama told advisers in 2009, sending his CIA chief and national security adviser to Islamabad to deliver the message.  \"You can't keep snakes in your backyard and expect them only to bite your neighbours\", warned then Secretary of State Hilary Clinton in 2011. The same year, America's top military officer publicly declared that the Haqqani network was \"a veritable arm\" of Pakistani intelligence. However, these warnings did not translate into action. Pakistan continued to receive around $1bn per year in so-called Coalition Support Funds, as well as other hundreds of millions of dollars in aid. The Trump administration has threatened a range of punishments, including sanctions on Pakistani officials. But will they follow through? This is what Pakistani officials will hope to establish in the coming weeks. The second question is how Pakistan will respond. In past crises, Pakistan has blocked Nato supply routes into Afghanistan, such as the Khyber Pass. There are alternative routes via Iran and Russia-dominated Central Asia, but the Trump administration's relations with Tehran and Moscow are even worse. Beyond this, Pakistan could also shoot American drones out of the sky, ramp up its support for the Taliban, or halt intelligence co-operation entirely. Of course, Pakistan would have to consider the consequences, from losing out on IMF bailouts to provoking open US air strikes.The third question is whether Pakistan can be coerced into abandoning a policy that has taken shape over 40 years. Both Mr Trump and Mr Tillerson declared their openness to peace talks between the Afghan government and the Taliban. Pakistan's concern is that if such talks result in its Taliban allies sharing power in Afghanistan, this would reduce the Taliban's dependence on Pakistan. Taliban leaders who have explored peace talks independently of their Pakistani patrons have ended up arrested or dead. It is possible that Pakistan will decide that it's worth maintaining influence over the Taliban, whatever the cost. Domestically, Pakistan has continued supporting militants despite the death of 20,000 civilians in terrorist attacks over the past 15 years. It's also notable that a meeting of Pakistani military and political leaders on Thursday concluded that the foreign minister should immediately set off on a tour of \"friendly states\", beginning with China. Pakistan is increasingly confident in the support of Beijing, which is investing tens of billions of dollars in the country as part of the ambitious China-Pakistan Economic Corridor (CPEC). However, it's not entirely clear how far China is willing to go to bail out Pakistan, financially or politically.Finally, what should we make of Trump's effort to enlist Indian support? Some critics have argued that this is likely to provoke Pakistan into expanding its support for the Taliban. However, we should bear in mind that the US tried to restrict India's role in Afghanistan through the 2000s, with no positive change in Pakistan's behaviour. Instead, Pakistan is believed to have sponsored the bombing of the Indian embassy in Kabul in 2008, though Islamabad denies this.India expanded its security role in Afghanistan from 2011 onwards, when it signed a strategic partnership with Kabul. It expanded its training of Afghan military officers, 4,000 so far, and gave second-hand attack helicopters to the struggling Afghan National Security Forces (ANSF). This, too, had no apparent impact on Pakistan's policy. We should be realistic about India's potential role. Delhi does not have the capacity to do too much more. It requires co-operation with its old partners Russia or Iran to send military supplies, but both those countries have expanded their own ties with parts of the Taliban in recent years. We should also note that President Trump emphasised India's role in the specific areas of \"economic assistance and development\". This assistance, to the tune of $2bn (£1.56bn), has contributed to India's popularity amongst Afghans. Delhi would not want military support to put that soft power at risk. But on balance, as Western countries focus on terrorist threats from the Middle East and North Africa, and grow more weary of the longest war in their modern history, India's support to a weak Afghan state and its army should probably be welcomed. Update 25 August 2017: The text referring to the bombing of the Indian embassy in Kabul in 2008 has been updated to include Islamabad's denial of involvement.",

            "title": "Should Africa be wary of Chinese debt?",
            "content": "African countries have shown a healthy appetite for Chinese loans but some experts now worry that the continent is gorging on debt, and could soon choke. The Entebbe-Kampala Expressway is still something of a tourist attraction for Ugandans, nearly three months after it opened. The 51km (31 mile), four-lane highway that connects the country's capital to the Entebbe International Airport was built by a Chinese company using a $476m (£366m) loan from the China Exim Bank.It has cut what was a torturous two-hour journey through some of Africa's worst traffic into a scenic 45-minute drive into the East Africa nation's capital.Uganda has taken $3bn of Chinese loans as part of a wider trend that Kampala-based economist Ramathan Ggoobi calls its \"unrivalled willingness to avail unconditional capital to Africa\".\"This debt acquired from China comes with huge business for Chinese companies, particularly construction companies that have turned the whole of Africa into a construction site for rails, roads, electricity dams, stadia, commercial buildings and so on,\" the Makerere University Business School lecturer told the BBC.The Chinese loans come as many African countries are once again in danger of defaulting on their debts more than a decade after many had their outstanding borrowing written off.At least 40% of low-income countries in the region are either in debt distress or at high risk, the International Monetary Fund warned in April. Chad, Eritrea, Mozambique, Congo Republic, South Sudan and Zimbabwe were considered to be in debt distress at the end of 2017 while Zambia and Ethiopia were downgraded to \"high risk of debt distress\".\"In 2017 alone, the newly signed value of Chinese contracted projects in Africa registered $76.5bn,\" Standard Bank's China Economist Jeremy Stevens wrote in a note. \"However, despite a sizeable remaining infrastructure deficit on the continent, there is a concern that African countries' debt-service ability will soon dissolve,\" he says. The Chinese model has many high-profile defenders on the continent, including the head of the African Development Bank (ADB) Akinwumi Adesina, a former Nigerian agriculture minister.\"A lot of people get nervous about China but I am not. I think China is Africa's friend,\" he told the BBC. China is now the single largest bilateral financier of infrastructure in Africa, surpassing the ADB, the European Commission, the European Investment Bank, the International Finance Corporation, the World Bank and the Group of eight (G8) countries combined.  The money's impact is conspicuous all over Africa, from shiny new airports and roads as well as ports and high-rise buildings that are also creating much-needed jobs.In fact, a McKinsey and Company analysis found that the amount of loans Beijing had made to Africa had tripled since 2012, including an outsize $19bn to Angola alone in 2015 and 2016. It cited Angola and Zambia as unbalanced partners with China in Africa. \"In Angola's case, the government has supplied oil to China in exchange for Chinese financing and construction of major infrastructure projects - but market driven private investment by Chinese firms has been limited compared with other African countries,\" the firm said.  Africa has made significant new gains in trade, investment and financing arrangements with China, says Ghanaian investment analyst Michael Kottoh. \"There are several truly win-win deals African nations have closed without the typical onerous conditions associated historically with doing business with western countries,\" says Mr Kottoh, whose advisory firm Konfidants counsels international clients. \"But there is a sense in which China is obviously the bigger winner - simply because it has the upper leverage in most negotiations.\"McKinsey projects that revenues for Chinese firms in Africa could hit $440bn by 2025. Even Mr Adesina agreed that: \"The issue that I have seen is the asymmetry of power in the negotiations of the transactions, where you are actually giving your mining rights away just because you want to build a superhighway.  \"You are only dealing with one country, how are you sure that you are getting the best deal?\"China does not have a Foreign Corrupt Practices Act like the United States, or similar legislation in other Western countries that criminalise bribes paid overseas in exchange for contracts. Even though Nobel Prize-winning economist Joseph Stiglitz calls the Western criticism of China's work in Africa \"sour grapes,\" he admits that there are corruption concerns. \"Every project whether it comes from the west or China needs to be evaluated against the rate of returns,\" he told the BBC in Nairobi but added that it was up to the continent's governments to be more transparent.Mr Ggoobi also says there are greater concerns over the environmental effects of Chinese investments, \"particularly given the poor, weak, corrupt regulatory institutional infrastructure in Africa\".In 2015, the China Africa Research Initiative at the Johns Hopkins School of Advanced International Studies sounded alarm bells that African countries might be unable to repay Chinese loans \"due to fluctuating commodity prices and decreasing absorptive capacity\".\"We find that Chinese loans are not currently a major contributor to debt distress in Africa,\" they now say in a new briefing paper ahead of the 7th Forum on China Africa Cooperation Summit this week in Beijing. China has the lion's share of African debt but the countries are borrowing from many other sources internationally so it is not single-handedly to blame for indebtedness. When the summit last met, in Johannesburg, China promised $35bn in concessional foreign aid loans among other credit lines to Africa. What has not improved is what Standard Bank calls a \"significant trade deficit with China\" since 2014. It says only five African countries have a trade surplus with China. Mr Ggoobi wants China to help Africa build institutional capacity to attract and host viable investments using avenues like special economic zones and industrial parks to shore up the continent's export-focused manufacturing. So far, China has only paid lip service to such long-term support that would wean African countries off their dependency on the Asian tiger. Djibouti last month launched the first phase of the Chinese-built free trade zone billed as Africa's largest but it is seen as just another piece of the jigsaw puzzle as China revives old trade routes in its Belt and Road Initiative which targets 60 countries. Ugandans might enjoy soaring above the swampy Nambigirwa Bridge on their new expressway, but there are real fears that they could end up drowning in Chinese debt. ",

            "title": "Endometriosis: The pair who helped change Australia's conversation",
            "content": "Australia recently launched its first \"national action plan\" targeting endometriosis. It followed the advocacy of many - not least a mother and daughter who used viral success to fuel a wider conversation, writes Gary Nunn in Sydney.Earlier this year, Sylvia Freedman received a message from a woman she'd never met disclosing something she found \"bizarre, but lovely!\"The woman had decided to name her baby Sylvia, because without Sylvia's advocacy, she'd never have got pregnant.Syl suffers from endometriosis. Endometriosis (endo) currently has no known cause and no cure. It can cause severe pelvic pain and infertility. Back in 2013, Syl's university tutor, who also had endo, offered to mentor her through an honours thesis on coverage of endometriosis in the media.Their web search for media mentions of endometriosis returned zero mentions of the disease in any major Australian media outlets over 10 years. The tutor withdrew her offer, saying Syl couldn't do a literature review with nothing to review.It was a fresh blow after a decade of confusion, debilitating pain, missed classes, losing jobs and endless hours on the couch hugging a hot water bottle, wishing she lived inside a different body.  Today, Sylvia, 27, is having a good day. She's able to sit upright on a chair opposite me and her mum, Lesley at their home in Sydney. In the past, endo often left her unable to sit up, walk or even do up her jeans. Syl feels much better now partly thanks to effective excision surgery, daily self-management and Visanne - a drug designed to treat endo.This medication is now available in Australia because Lesley and Sylvia took on pharmaceutical giant Bayer - and won.Lesley discovered that Visanne was having success in treating endo-related pain overseas, but Bayer would not bring it to Australia and New Zealand. \"The marketing manager said I'd need to convince them there's a market for it here,\" she says.Lesley started emailing her friends, but Syl thought there had to be a quicker way. She shared her story on Change.org, asking people to sign their petition targeting Bayer. The signatures would prove the need.In total, they got 74,064 signers. Though the medication does not work for everyone, the pair were thrilled. Lesley wrote to supporters online: \"Together, we've changed the mind of one of the world's biggest pharmaceutical companies.\" From there they founded their own not-for-profit, EndoActive, which raises awareness, provides evidence-based information and advocates on behalf of the 700,000 women and girls with endo in Australia. They convened Australia's first patient-centred endometriosis conference in 2015. \"Women were in tears before they even walked through the doors, relieved they were finally being taken seriously,\" Lesley says. \"Many women are not believed or told painful periods are normal.\" This awareness, along with work by others, helped bring about Australia's first National Action Plan for Endometriosis, launched last month.\"[Endo] is a silent epidemic, hidden due to stigma, misunderstanding, and society's easy dismissal of the importance and severity of pain in women,\" says Dr Susan Evans, a gynaecologist who is chair of the Pelvic Pain Foundation of Australia. \"Syl and Lesley have presented the story of girls and women in pain in a way that Australians appreciate, understand, and relate to. They've built on the work by women, advocates and consumers over many years to dramatically raise the profile of the condition.\"It's estimated that one in 10 women have endo. It occurs when tissue similar to the womb lining grows outside it in other parts of the body (from reproductive organs up to the brain), in some cases strangling and gluing together other organs, causing excruciating pain. It takes, on average, seven to 12 years to get diagnosed. Symptoms vary but can be devastating: many experience crippling pelvic pain, 30% have fertility problems, and 66% experience pain during sex.Syl would often turn up to work then vomit violently straight away. She was constantly fatigued. Two surgeries took months to recover from. \"Endo symptoms are so weird and so random you feel like you're going insane,\" she says. \"I still get anxious that people think I'm faking it.\"The problem is, endo is an invisible illness. \"The other day I had conjunctivitis\" Syl says. \"Everyone was saying 'you poor thing'. I thought, this is nothing! If only endo was this obvious.\"Women have had to face such challenges in the diagnosis and treatment of endo, that Health Minister Greg Hunt made a national apology in December to recognise the pain and problems they've encountered in receiving adequate medical advice and treatment. \"Hearing that was so moving,\" Syl says.Mr Hunt recently made a A$4.7m (£2.7m; $3.4m) commitment to the National Action Plan for Endometriosis and Syl now sits on the steering committee. Their first meeting will have many action points but debunking myths is high on Syl's list.\"Like so many women, I was told by a doctor that getting pregnant would help my pain,\" she says. \"I was 21, in agony and without a partner. I asked my best friend, who's gay, if he'd consider having a baby with me. Mum considered recruiting her friend's son. I'd never even met him. That's how desperate we were. \"Now we know pregnancy isn't a cure. We need to re-educate doctors as well as patients.\"Dr Evans says: \"Throughout the world, endometriosis and pelvic pain are under-recognised, under-researched, under-managed and under-supported. There's vast unmet human need in this area and change has been slow.\"",
